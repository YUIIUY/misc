1
00:02:14,159-->00:02:18,80
It was here that I first met Marquess Guo.

2
00:02:18,159-->00:02:20,800
He saw my bare feet

3
00:02:20,879-->00:02:23,599
and expressed his admiration with quotations from the classics.

4
00:02:23,680-->00:02:27,879
I flushed with shame, flustered and exasperated by what he said.

5
00:02:27,960-->00:02:30,639
I never imagined that in the future

6
00:02:30,719-->00:02:33,679
he would become the true love of my life.

7
00:02:34,520-->00:02:38,160
And I would become his entire world as well.

8
00:02:38,919-->00:02:43,280
The love between Yunli and myself has been a curing remedy in my life,

9
00:02:43,879-->00:02:48,800
yet it also became the poison wine which he willingly drank.

10
00:02:51,839-->00:02:52,840
My lady,

11
00:02:53,319-->00:02:55,479
Consort Li would like to meet with you.

12
00:02:58,960-->00:03:00,0
Very well.

13
00:03:00,999-->00:03:03,919
Eunuch Su, keep it secret. Do not raise alarm.

14
00:03:04,0-->00:03:05,520
Please rest easy. I shall see to it.

15
00:03:06,599-->00:03:08,520
One more thing,

16
00:03:08,599-->00:03:11,320
Consort Li would like to eat bitter almonds.

17
00:03:13,40-->00:03:16,279
His Majesty has stated that all of her needs shall be provided.

18
00:03:16,360-->00:03:17,960
She remains Consort Li.

19
00:03:30,120-->00:03:31,639
Huan, you have come.

20
00:03:33,479-->00:03:37,519
Look at me. Does my face show signs of aging?

21
00:03:38,719-->00:03:40,800
Do I look the same as before?

22
00:03:42,639-->00:03:44,80
Your face is unchanged.

23
00:03:44,919-->00:03:48,919
Yet your heart is no longer as simple as it once was.

24
00:03:49,520-->00:03:51,919
If I had remained as artless as before,

25
00:03:52,800-->00:03:57,360
I likely would have died many times over in this harem.

26
00:03:59,120-->00:04:01,240
Consort Hua was shrewd and overbearing.

27
00:04:02,519-->00:04:04,199
The Empress is adept at intrigue.

28
00:04:06,399-->00:04:07,759
I live in deep fear.

29
00:04:09,160-->00:04:10,800
By night, I am set upon by nightmares.

30
00:04:12,40-->00:04:15,960
Cruelty and humiliation have made my life unbearable.

31
00:04:16,639-->00:04:19,279
Everyone finds life in the harem most difficult.

32
00:04:19,959-->00:04:21,879
Yet no matter how difficult it becomes,

33
00:04:21,959-->00:04:24,279
how much you must steel yourself at each step,

34
00:04:25,120-->00:04:27,399
you should not do harm to those around you.

35
00:04:28,759-->00:04:32,40
Especially those who have always treated you as a sister.

36
00:04:32,920-->00:04:37,359
Once I believed your kindness was sincere.

37
00:04:38,640-->00:04:40,519
Later I learned

38
00:04:41,120-->00:04:42,639
that you treated me well,

39
00:04:43,399-->00:04:47,240
always looked after me and lent me a hand

40
00:04:47,320-->00:04:49,959
only to have me vie with Shen Meizhuang for the Emperor's favor.

41
00:04:51,120-->00:04:54,0
All in order to consolidate your own status within the palace.

42
00:04:54,79-->00:04:55,159
Since we entered the palace,

43
00:04:55,239-->00:04:57,40
we have depended on one other for survival.

44
00:04:58,0-->00:05:01,79
I would never force you to do anything you were unwilling to do.

45
00:05:01,880-->00:05:03,919
During the time of Mei's confinement,

46
00:05:04,519-->00:05:06,40
if I had not been allied with you,

47
00:05:07,519-->00:05:09,199
we would have faced cruel oppression everywhere.

48
00:05:10,720-->00:05:13,440
These bitter almonds are delicious.

49
00:05:15,160-->00:05:17,199
After living in the palace for so long,

50
00:05:18,760-->00:05:21,120
even bitter almonds taste sweet to me.

51
00:05:24,120-->00:05:28,160
Do not bear grudges against me. And do not say that I am vicious.

52
00:05:28,800-->00:05:30,600
For after all,

53
00:05:31,479-->00:05:33,199
it is you I hate the most

54
00:05:34,919-->00:05:37,319
because you possess everything

55
00:05:39,679-->00:05:41,959
while I have nothing.

56
00:05:43,240-->00:05:46,880
I knew full well that the aid the Empress offered me was insincere.

57
00:05:48,480-->00:05:50,920
However, within the harem,

58
00:05:50,999-->00:05:53,160
there is no such thing as sincerity.

59
00:05:55,159-->00:05:59,759
Nights in the palace were so cold and so long

60
00:06:01,360-->00:06:06,240
that I shudder to think how I survived every single second of those nights.

61
00:06:06,319-->00:06:07,399
No matter how cold,

62
00:06:09,120-->00:06:11,199
you should not warm yourself with the blood of others.

63
00:06:13,639-->00:06:15,79
I will not hate you.

64
00:06:16,959-->00:06:18,800
Nor will I forgive you.

65
00:06:19,760-->00:06:21,439
For you are not worthy of either.

66
00:06:21,519-->00:06:22,920
Exactly.

67
00:06:24,199-->00:06:25,879
My entire life

68
00:06:27,40-->00:06:29,360
has been unworthy from the start.

69
00:06:36,639-->00:06:37,680
Huan.

70
00:06:44,79-->00:06:45,759
I am sorry.

71
00:07:07,79-->00:07:08,959
My life,

72
00:07:10,160-->00:07:11,959
my very breath,

73
00:07:13,440-->00:07:16,79
has never been mine to command.

74
00:07:18,999-->00:07:20,600
Today,

75
00:07:23,759-->00:07:26,440
it is finally up to me

76
00:07:27,720-->00:07:30,0
to choose my own fate.

77
00:07:43,560-->00:07:46,680
My lady, why did you remain inside for so long?

78
00:07:47,360-->00:07:49,160
What did Consort Li say to you?

79
00:07:49,240-->00:07:50,639
Nothing of importance.

80
00:07:50,720-->00:07:52,759
She is truly pitiful.

81
00:07:53,360-->00:07:56,199
Consort Li has passed away!

82
00:08:07,360-->00:08:09,679
Hongli, it has been hot recently.

83
00:08:09,759-->00:08:11,360
AISIN GIORO HONGLI

84
00:08:11,440-->00:08:14,760
Your old maidservant says that you study until midnight every night.

85
00:08:14,840-->00:08:18,399
Profound study is good, yet you must also care for your health.

86
00:08:18,479-->00:08:22,119
Mother, you send me soup every night. I haven't felt tired at all.

87
00:08:22,199-->00:08:25,920
The bowl of soup is to remind you that it is time for rest,

88
00:08:26,0-->00:08:27,959
not to encourage further studies afterwards.

89
00:08:28,40-->00:08:29,480
Then I have misunderstood.

90
00:08:29,559-->00:08:31,199
I greet Noble Consort Xi and the Fourth Prince.

91
00:08:31,279-->00:08:33,159
-The hour is late. -Concubine Ning.

92
00:08:33,240-->00:08:34,519
Why do you stand here alone?

93
00:08:34,599-->00:08:36,640
I've come by the order of His Majesty.

94
00:08:36,720-->00:08:38,640
However, the Third Prince is inside now.

95
00:08:38,719-->00:08:43,799
Eunuch Su says His Majesty is in a rage. He asked me to wait outside for a while.

96
00:08:44,840-->00:08:48,39
By the way, Your Highness, I am told you are quite assiduous in your studies.

97
00:08:48,119-->00:08:50,720
Can you recite the classics His Majesty mentioned just now?

98
00:08:50,799-->00:08:53,960
How could I compare to the Third Brother? I started schooling at a later age.

99
00:08:54,39-->00:08:56,360
If I am assiduous, it means I have much to learn.

100
00:08:56,440-->00:09:01,80
That is why I spend much time on it. Otherwise, my teachers will reprimand me.

101
00:09:01,159-->00:09:04,39
Study this passage thoroughly for three more days.

102
00:09:04,120-->00:09:07,440
If you cannot interpret its meaning, do not come to see me anymore.

103
00:09:13,399-->00:09:14,760
AISIN GIORO HONGSHI

104
00:09:14,840-->00:09:17,599
I greet Noble Consort Xi and Concubine Ning.

105
00:09:18,200-->00:09:19,280
You should go in now.

106
00:09:28,639-->00:09:30,399
His Majesty was simply vexed.

107
00:09:30,480-->00:09:32,320
It was inevitable that he spoke so harshly.

108
00:09:32,399-->00:09:33,600
Do not pay it heed.

109
00:09:34,440-->00:09:37,919
After all, you two are father and son. He will relent in a few days.

110
00:09:38,719-->00:09:40,120
I understand.

111
00:09:40,199-->00:09:43,840
The hour is late. I must excuse myself.

112
00:09:48,799-->00:09:51,840
Mother, Third Brother studies quite hard.

113
00:09:52,639-->00:09:55,559
I must study harder than he does. Only then will Imperial Father like me.

114
00:09:57,359-->00:09:59,519
You told Concubine Ning you could not recite

115
00:09:59,600-->00:10:02,39
the classics His Majesty mentioned.

116
00:10:02,759-->00:10:05,279
Yet I overheard you reciting them a few days ago.

117
00:10:05,360-->00:10:08,39
You were able to interpret those passages correctly and recite them fluently.

118
00:10:08,120-->00:10:09,600
Mother, you never call attention to yourself.

119
00:10:09,679-->00:10:12,639
I take instruction from your example. Of course I will do likewise.

120
00:10:12,719-->00:10:13,919
You are quite astute.

121
00:10:13,999-->00:10:17,880
We are family. Of course I resemble you.

122
00:10:18,559-->00:10:20,919
Has everything been properly arranged for the Third Prince?

123
00:10:20,999-->00:10:24,440
As you instructed, the Third Prince has composed a poem as a gift for His Majesty.

124
00:10:25,400-->00:10:28,759
Many days were spent preparing it. His Majesty will surely be pleased.

125
00:10:28,840-->00:10:30,720
On the late Emperor's birthday, His Majesty

126
00:10:30,799-->00:10:31,999
shows special reverence for his father.

127
00:10:32,559-->00:10:34,159
He will definitely be moved easily.

128
00:10:34,800-->00:10:37,559
The Third Prince just needs to make an effort.

129
00:10:38,399-->00:10:39,999
As the eldest son, it's natural His Majesty

130
00:10:40,80-->00:10:41,919
places high expectations in him.

131
00:10:43,0-->00:10:47,959
I will persuade the high-ranking officials to vouch for the Third Prince.

132
00:10:48,39-->00:10:50,200
Hopefully, he will gain recognition and support

133
00:10:50,279-->00:10:52,520
so that His Majesty may select him as Crown Prince with confidence.

134
00:10:52,999-->00:10:55,879
With the aid of Your Highness, everything will turn out well.

135
00:11:03,799-->00:11:05,839
Doctor Wei, what's wrong with my lady?

136
00:11:05,919-->00:11:08,600
She cannot hold down her food, and her sleep is fitful at night.

137
00:11:08,679-->00:11:09,759
What could be wrong?

138
00:11:10,279-->00:11:14,400
I must send for Doctor Wen at once. Perhaps he can save the unborn child.

139
00:11:17,880-->00:11:20,479
How has Noble Consort Xi fared these last two days?

140
00:11:21,159-->00:11:24,239
The imperial doctor says she suffers from a digestive disorder.

141
00:11:24,320-->00:11:25,719
She is continually ill and weak.

142
00:11:26,960-->00:11:29,240
During the morning audience at court,

143
00:11:29,320-->00:11:32,120
Ortai debated Maci.

144
00:11:32,200-->00:11:33,679
I listened to their discussion.

145
00:11:33,760-->00:11:35,200
It concerned the selection of Crown Prince.

146
00:11:36,240-->00:11:37,960
Inside and outside the palace,

147
00:11:38,919-->00:11:44,359
heaven knows how many people have their eyes fixed on this throne.

148
00:11:45,559-->00:11:49,359
Selecting the Crown Prince openly will surely bring disorder.

149
00:11:50,200-->00:11:53,399
I must devise a way to be prepared for any contingency.

150
00:11:54,80-->00:11:55,559
Your Majesty, you are right.

151
00:11:56,159-->00:11:57,400
I am well aware

152
00:12:00,239-->00:12:01,840
that though the harem

153
00:12:03,440-->00:12:05,880
seems calm and tranquil outwardly,

154
00:12:06,480-->00:12:08,919
it is in fact filled with depravity.

155
00:12:09,0-->00:12:10,519
My real concern

156
00:12:11,880-->00:12:15,519
is that the harem and the state are linked

157
00:12:16,440-->00:12:18,240
and entangled.

158
00:12:19,39-->00:12:22,440
I must take precautions and be well prepared.

159
00:12:29,639-->00:12:31,320
My lady,

160
00:12:31,400-->00:12:33,559
I believe Wei Lin has done all that is possible.

161
00:12:34,959-->00:12:37,600
-Unfortunately... -What is it?

162
00:12:37,679-->00:12:39,279
You have carried this child only a short while,

163
00:12:39,360-->00:12:41,919
yet you are in constant agitation and depression.

164
00:12:41,999-->00:12:45,799
You are still weakened from the birth of the twins.

165
00:12:45,880-->00:12:47,720
Now is not the time for another child.

166
00:12:49,120-->00:12:51,280
My lady, four months have passed already.

167
00:12:52,200-->00:12:53,240
This child...

168
00:12:54,0-->00:12:56,720
Even though Wei Lin and I may do everything known to our medical art,

169
00:12:57,879-->00:13:00,320
you will carry the child no more than five months.

170
00:13:00,919-->00:13:03,240
-Five months? -Exactly.

171
00:13:07,639-->00:13:09,759
Then the bond between us

172
00:13:10,559-->00:13:14,279
will last no longer than one more month?

173
00:13:14,359-->00:13:16,440
My lady, your health is of great importance.

174
00:13:16,519-->00:13:18,840
You will conceive another child someday.

175
00:13:20,320-->00:13:22,0
Tell no one

176
00:13:23,359-->00:13:25,600
of what you know.

177
00:13:28,559-->00:13:30,559
Help me to carry this child as long as possible.

178
00:13:32,399-->00:13:33,440
Besides that,

179
00:13:34,559-->00:13:36,799
you must prepare medication in advance

180
00:13:37,720-->00:13:40,440
that will bring this to an end.

181
00:13:40,519-->00:13:42,400
Perhaps at some point,

182
00:13:44,359-->00:13:46,720
this child may yet do me a great favor.

183
00:13:46,799-->00:13:48,200
I understand.

184
00:13:53,240-->00:13:56,360
The officials of Qiongzhou have sent us a large red coral in tribute.

185
00:13:57,80-->00:13:58,759
It is truly rare.

186
00:13:58,840-->00:14:02,919
Hinayana Buddhism regards red coral as the reincarnation of Tathagata.

187
00:14:03,0-->00:14:05,919
It would make the finest protective charm for the child.

188
00:14:06,640-->00:14:08,320
With such a precious coral,

189
00:14:08,919-->00:14:11,480
it would be a pity to hide it away.

190
00:14:12,159-->00:14:16,840
We must invite all the concubines to Yongshou Palace to view it.

191
00:14:17,840-->00:14:19,559
You may do as you wish.

192
00:14:20,320-->00:14:23,80
It just so happens that the priest of Baohua Temple

193
00:14:23,159-->00:14:26,480
has made some amulets to bless my unborn child.

194
00:14:26,559-->00:14:29,480
The priest says it must be those of highest rank in the harem

195
00:14:29,559-->00:14:33,879
to place each amulet in a blessed pouch and fasten it at my bedside.

196
00:14:33,960-->00:14:35,960
Then the ritual will be completed.

197
00:14:36,39-->00:14:38,519
The most suitable persons

198
00:14:38,600-->00:14:42,159
are the Empress, Imperial Noble Consort Duan and Noble Consort Jing.

199
00:14:42,240-->00:14:46,440
I myself will fasten one of them. That will complete the four corners.

200
00:14:46,519-->00:14:50,279
It is an act that vouchsafes great blessings, they will not refuse.

201
00:14:50,360-->00:14:51,840
The Empress rarely comes out nowadays.

202
00:14:51,919-->00:14:54,360
She has refused all invitations from others.

203
00:14:54,440-->00:14:58,159
However, if the Empress is absent, the ritual will not be perfect.

204
00:14:59,279-->00:15:02,200
If it is your wish, I will issue the invitation personally.

205
00:15:07,399-->00:15:09,520
Why has the Empress failed to arrive?

206
00:15:10,279-->00:15:12,760
Could it be that the Empress is displeased with me?

207
00:15:12,840-->00:15:13,880
No, it can't be.

208
00:15:13,960-->00:15:17,39
She is the Empress. She is obliged to be magnanimous.

209
00:15:17,519-->00:15:20,679
Her Highness the Empress!

210
00:15:22,600-->00:15:26,120
Your Highness, may blessings and peace be with you.

211
00:15:26,919-->00:15:30,200
I greet Your Majesty. May blessings and peace be with you.

212
00:15:30,799-->00:15:33,399
-Please rise. -Yes, Your Majesty.

213
00:15:33,479-->00:15:37,759
Even in your illness, I asked you to come. I have troubled you. Do you resent me?

214
00:15:37,839-->00:15:39,200
How could I?

215
00:15:39,279-->00:15:41,880
Your Majesty and myself are joined as a couple.

216
00:15:41,960-->00:15:44,840
How could I not be concerned for Noble Consort Xi?

217
00:15:47,280-->00:15:48,999
The Empress is most virtuous.

218
00:15:53,960-->00:15:55,799
Your Highness,

219
00:15:55,879-->00:15:59,559
the priest says these amulets and blessed pouches are auspicious tokens.

220
00:15:59,639-->00:16:02,599
They can secure peace and good health for my unborn child.

221
00:16:03,279-->00:16:05,919
But I must trouble Your Highness and two high-ranking concubines

222
00:16:06,0-->00:16:08,679
to place each amulet in a blessed pouch

223
00:16:08,760-->00:16:10,720
and then fasten them at my bedside.

224
00:16:11,479-->00:16:14,279
It is no trouble. It is our pleasure.

225
00:16:14,360-->00:16:17,399
Your Majesty, Noble Consort Xi is carrying a child.

226
00:16:17,480-->00:16:19,960
Naturally, the tutelary god is guarding over her bedchamber.

227
00:16:20,960-->00:16:22,680
I bring my illness.

228
00:16:23,279-->00:16:27,760
Moreover, a stranger may offend the god by entering the bedchamber. It is unwise.

229
00:16:27,840-->00:16:29,840
Imperial Noble Consort Duan and Noble Consort Jing

230
00:16:29,919-->00:16:32,720
do not mind performing this modest task.

231
00:16:32,800-->00:16:35,519
Why do you try to avoid it with so many excuses?

232
00:16:35,600-->00:16:38,639
As head of the harem, you should be responsible for maintaining harmony

233
00:16:39,239-->00:16:41,520
and set an example for all the concubines.

234
00:16:43,79-->00:16:44,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

235
00:16:47,879-->00:16:51,120
We servants are too lowly to touch these auspicious items.

236
00:16:51,799-->00:16:56,600
Therefore, we shall not enter my lady's bedchamber with you

237
00:16:56,679-->00:16:58,239
lest we offend the gods.

238
00:16:58,320-->00:17:00,0
It would not be wise.

239
00:17:00,80-->00:17:03,639
You are right. We must be especially cautious with regard to such matters.

240
00:17:03,720-->00:17:05,199
I will carry them.

241
00:17:11,880-->00:17:15,960
My lady, you have not taken your medicinal tonic yet.

242
00:17:16,39-->00:17:18,920
You said it was too hot when it was sent to you earlier.

243
00:17:18,999-->00:17:20,160
Now it is merely warm.

244
00:17:20,240-->00:17:21,959
If you don't take it now, it will cool down.

245
00:17:38,799-->00:17:41,999
The Empress is truly exemplary when she reveals her virtuous nature.

246
00:17:43,79-->00:17:45,720
She has always disliked Noble Consort Xi.

247
00:17:45,799-->00:17:48,840
Nonetheless, she now yields to her for the greater good.

248
00:17:48,920-->00:17:50,399
Do not speak ill of the Empress.

249
00:17:58,319-->00:18:00,920
I am grateful to Your Highness for fulfilling my wish,

250
00:18:00,999-->00:18:04,40
for agreeing to fasten this blessed pouch for me.

251
00:18:04,640-->00:18:07,479
I am the Empress. I am obliged to do so.

252
00:18:08,319-->00:18:10,239
You are bound by custom to do so.

253
00:18:10,320-->00:18:15,479
But inwardly, Your Highness must hate me to the core.

254
00:18:18,720-->00:18:22,599
I hope you can maintain your composure and not lose yourself in distractions.

255
00:18:22,680-->00:18:26,240
Your first priority now should be the birth of His Majesty's child.

256
00:18:28,119-->00:18:32,519
Whether the child will be born or not depends entirely on the Empress, not me.

257
00:18:32,599-->00:18:34,640
Impudence! How dare you slander me!

258
00:18:34,720-->00:18:36,439
Slander?

259
00:18:37,359-->00:18:38,599
Let go.

260
00:18:38,680-->00:18:42,400
Will you swear upon the gods that you have never harmed any imperial heirs,

261
00:18:42,480-->00:18:45,279
that you have never harmed any of the concubines, including myself?

262
00:18:45,880-->00:18:48,599
I am head of the harem. How could I swear vows by your command?

263
00:18:49,279-->00:18:50,760
Why did Consort Qi die?

264
00:18:51,759-->00:18:54,199
Why did Concubine Ning become barren?

265
00:18:54,280-->00:18:56,0
Lady Fucha miscarried

266
00:18:56,599-->00:18:58,880
and I lost my own child.

267
00:18:59,640-->00:19:03,640
So many shameful things, all originating with you.

268
00:19:13,359-->00:19:15,679
-How did it happen? -What's wrong with my lady?

269
00:19:15,760-->00:19:17,160
My lady.

270
00:19:17,239-->00:19:18,400
What happened to my lady?

271
00:19:18,479-->00:19:20,919
My lady, what's the matter?

272
00:19:21,0-->00:19:24,119
Help! My lady!

273
00:19:24,199-->00:19:26,400
-Huan Huan. -Your Majesty, she has fainted.

274
00:19:26,479-->00:19:27,680
Summon the doctor.

275
00:19:27,760-->00:19:30,79
-Go quickly. -Imperial doctor!

276
00:19:47,640-->00:19:49,720
Noble Consort Xi, you are awake.

277
00:19:51,239-->00:19:53,79
Noble Consort Xi, please contain your grief.

278
00:19:53,160-->00:19:55,79
You will conceive another child someday.

279
00:19:57,40-->00:19:59,799
"I will conceive another child someday"?

280
00:19:59,880-->00:20:02,800
You say that so plainly.

281
00:20:03,720-->00:20:05,960
Was the life of my child so insignificant?

282
00:20:08,160-->00:20:09,919
Your Highness,

283
00:20:10,599-->00:20:13,680
no matter how great your hatred for me,

284
00:20:13,759-->00:20:16,839
why did you have to harm my child?

285
00:20:18,359-->00:20:21,520
Preposterous! When did I harm your child?

286
00:20:22,599-->00:20:25,959
Your Majesty.

287
00:20:26,920-->00:20:29,520
I have lost my child.

288
00:20:30,519-->00:20:32,759
It was not caused by my carelessness.

289
00:20:34,400-->00:20:36,0
It was Her Highness the Empress.

290
00:20:37,359-->00:20:39,640
She and I came into conflict.

291
00:20:40,439-->00:20:42,79
Then she pushed me.

292
00:20:48,239-->00:20:52,79
Your Majesty, her abdomen indeed shows signs of a heavy blow.

293
00:20:52,960-->00:20:54,239
Any imperial doctor can verify this.

294
00:20:54,919-->00:20:57,640
She had to be pushed forcefully by someone.

295
00:20:57,719-->00:21:00,200
Besides, her unborn child had been of sound health.

296
00:21:00,279-->00:21:03,880
It is probable that Your Majesty has even felt the child move.

297
00:21:03,959-->00:21:07,119
If not for an accident, she would not have miscarried.

298
00:21:10,200-->00:21:11,200
Empress,

299
00:21:12,240-->00:21:16,920
only you and Noble Consort Xi were in the bedchamber at that time.

300
00:21:17,0-->00:21:18,0
Your Majesty.

301
00:21:18,79-->00:21:21,480
There are many witnesses here, including myself.

302
00:21:23,119-->00:21:26,880
As Noble Consort Xi lay injured and prone, the Empress was the only person near her.

303
00:21:27,839-->00:21:29,320
Your Majesty.

304
00:21:29,920-->00:21:32,519
The Empress has long begrudged me the favor shown to me.

305
00:21:33,200-->00:21:36,359
She has always felt I disrespected her. So she scolded me.

306
00:21:37,720-->00:21:41,839
In a fit of rage, she pushed me.

307
00:21:43,39-->00:21:46,519
At that moment, Noble Consort Xi grew desperate and dared grasp my hand.

308
00:21:46,599-->00:21:50,399
I struggled vigorously to shake her grip. But I never pushed Noble Consort Xi.

309
00:21:51,239-->00:21:52,640
Empress, from what you have said,

310
00:21:52,720-->00:21:56,240
you mean that it was Noble Consort Xi who tossed herself to the ground?

311
00:21:56,839-->00:21:59,160
You have said that Noble Consort Xi became desperate,

312
00:21:59,759-->00:22:04,319
then how on earth did she offend you?

313
00:22:04,920-->00:22:09,800
Only Noble Consort Xi and I were inside the bedchamber.

314
00:22:09,880-->00:22:11,599
There's nothing I can say on that account.

315
00:22:12,560-->00:22:14,640
But if it appears I had some role in this,

316
00:22:14,720-->00:22:17,759
it is because someone has arranged things to appear that way.

317
00:22:18,720-->00:22:20,119
You claim there's nothing you can say.

318
00:22:21,79-->00:22:24,239
But there's nothing I can say to explain how this happened either.

319
00:22:24,960-->00:22:28,759
You have always disliked Noble Consort Xi. I know that full well.

320
00:22:28,839-->00:22:33,359
Yet Noble Consort Xi has always shown deference to you to maintain harmony.

321
00:22:35,719-->00:22:39,280
Your Majesty, there is no reason for me to harm Noble Consort Xi.

322
00:22:39,359-->00:22:41,640
I swear upon my ancestors of the Ula Nara clan.

323
00:22:41,720-->00:22:46,39
I have done nothing to harm the unborn child of Noble Consort Xi!

324
00:22:46,119-->00:22:47,839
You would do better to swear it again

325
00:22:47,920-->00:22:50,399
before the memorial of the Empress Dowager.

326
00:22:52,400-->00:22:56,319
The Empress is vicious and has harmed an imperial heir.

327
00:22:57,400-->00:22:59,480
Henceforward,

328
00:22:59,559-->00:23:01,799
she will be confined to Jingren Palace.

329
00:23:04,760-->00:23:06,720
-Su Peisheng. -Your Majesty.

330
00:23:06,799-->00:23:09,239
-Take her away. -Yes, sir.

331
00:23:10,880-->00:23:14,79
Your Highness, please come with me.

332
00:23:27,560-->00:23:31,79
Mother, I know you are grieved at the death of my unborn brother.

333
00:23:31,160-->00:23:33,959
I transcribed some prayer flags and burned them for my little brother.

334
00:23:34,40-->00:23:35,319
I hope he may find peace.

335
00:23:37,359-->00:23:38,640
You are truly dutiful to family.

336
00:23:41,279-->00:23:43,200
How fares the Third Prince?

337
00:23:43,280-->00:23:47,119
The Third Prince and the Empress are as closely united as hand in glove.

338
00:23:48,320-->00:23:51,640
Naturally, with the Empress present,

339
00:23:51,720-->00:23:53,640
the Third Prince is likely to win the throne.

340
00:23:55,0-->00:23:59,799
And with the Third Prince present, the Empress has one more ally.

341
00:23:59,880-->00:24:02,119
Yes, I understand.

342
00:24:07,520-->00:24:11,159
Fourth Brother, you are always studying. How are you at leisure today?

343
00:24:11,240-->00:24:12,319
It is our Eighth Uncle's birthday.

344
00:24:12,400-->00:24:15,319
I visited him at the prison of the Imperial Clan Court.

345
00:24:16,119-->00:24:19,720
You dared to visit our Eighth Uncle? Were you not afraid of being seen?

346
00:24:19,799-->00:24:21,759
Of course I concealed it from others.

347
00:24:21,839-->00:24:25,320
But I dare not hide it from my own brother.

348
00:24:25,400-->00:24:27,799
How fares our Eighth Uncle?

349
00:24:29,680-->00:24:33,640
How else? His title was revoked and he is imprisoned in unbearable conditions.

350
00:24:33,720-->00:24:36,319
Third Brother, I wish to tell you something,

351
00:24:36,400-->00:24:38,319
but I don't know if it is appropriate.

352
00:24:38,400-->00:24:41,479
We are brothers. We can dispense with formalities.

353
00:24:42,680-->00:24:43,960
Our father imprisoned several clan relatives

354
00:24:44,39-->00:24:45,440
due to struggles over the throne.

355
00:24:45,519-->00:24:49,160
The Eighth Uncle and the 14th Uncle are both brothers to our Imperial Father.

356
00:24:49,960-->00:24:54,80
If we intercede for them and thus allow our Imperial Father to forgive them,

357
00:24:54,160-->00:24:56,0
not only will his reputation be cemented,

358
00:24:56,559-->00:24:59,640
sparing him condemnation as a fratricide for hundreds of years,

359
00:24:59,720-->00:25:02,599
but it will also allow the Empress Dowager to rest in peace.

360
00:25:02,680-->00:25:04,119
The late Emperor's birthday is next month.

361
00:25:04,880-->00:25:06,480
If the opportunity arises,

362
00:25:06,559-->00:25:09,600
I plan to beg our father to forgive the Eighth Uncle and the 14th Uncle.

363
00:25:10,119-->00:25:11,119
It will also show deep filial piety towards

364
00:25:11,240-->00:25:13,719
the late Emperor and the Empress Dowager.

365
00:25:14,520-->00:25:16,880
Brother, you have given much thought to this.

366
00:25:16,960-->00:25:19,119
It had not even occurred to me.

367
00:25:19,200-->00:25:22,640
Very well. If the opportunity arises on that day,

368
00:25:22,720-->00:25:25,239
I will ask our father to show mercy and try to convince him.

369
00:25:25,320-->00:25:26,640
Good.

370
00:25:29,759-->00:25:32,519
Your Highness, bad news!

371
00:25:32,599-->00:25:34,839
The Third Prince has been removed from the imperial lineage

372
00:25:34,920-->00:25:36,839
and renamed son of the Eighth Lord.

373
00:25:37,599-->00:25:38,960
What are you talking about?

374
00:25:39,39-->00:25:41,479
The Imperial Clan Court has already received the decree.

375
00:25:41,559-->00:25:42,839
Nonsense!

376
00:25:42,920-->00:25:46,680
The Third Prince is His Majesty's own son. How can it be?

377
00:25:47,280-->00:25:48,759
I dare not lie.

378
00:25:48,840-->00:25:49,880
The Third Prince interceded for the 14th Lord,

379
00:25:49,960-->00:25:51,759
the Eighth Lord and yourself.

380
00:25:51,839-->00:25:53,760
His Majesty berated him for his disloyalty.

381
00:25:56,279-->00:26:01,119
Everything was going well. Why did he intercede for those offenders?

382
00:26:02,920-->00:26:06,200
All the painstaking effort I have spent over so many years was in vain.

383
00:26:06,839-->00:26:08,440
It was all in vain!

384
00:26:08,519-->00:26:10,320
You must devise a way to save the Prince.

385
00:26:10,400-->00:26:11,679
Useless fool!

386
00:26:13,839-->00:26:16,160
His Majesty has always been ruthless.

387
00:26:16,240-->00:26:20,280
And now, the ties between father and son have broken.

388
00:26:21,239-->00:26:24,600
Your Highness, if the Third Prince cannot be selected as Crown Prince...

389
00:26:24,680-->00:26:29,200
Without the Third Prince, he still has the Fourth Prince and the Fifth Prince.

390
00:26:29,279-->00:26:31,799
In the worst case, the Sixth Prince may be chosen as well.

391
00:26:32,640-->00:26:33,840
The Sixth Prince?

392
00:26:33,920-->00:26:36,400
Just as took place after Consort Qi died.

393
00:26:36,480-->00:26:37,880
Without Zhen Huan,

394
00:26:38,479-->00:26:40,720
I could raise the Sixth Prince.

395
00:26:41,679-->00:26:44,520
As long as I remain the Empress,

396
00:26:44,599-->00:26:48,640
as long as a chance remains for me to reestablish myself,

397
00:26:49,319-->00:26:51,200
it doesn't matter whose child he is.

398
00:26:52,319-->00:26:54,359
As long as I am appointed his mother,

399
00:26:55,279-->00:26:58,920
I will be the one true Empress Dowager.

400
00:27:02,880-->00:27:06,79
-Have you prepared what I asked for? -It is ready now.

401
00:27:06,160-->00:27:09,680
The Empress knows nothing of it. Should we report it to her?

402
00:27:09,759-->00:27:11,760
A master disgraced while her servants do nothing!

403
00:27:12,359-->00:27:16,359
I have served the Empress for years. Never has she suffered such humiliation.

404
00:27:17,160-->00:27:20,519
The Empress herself, framed by a lowly concubine and confined to her palace.

405
00:27:20,599-->00:27:23,119
The Empress's hopes for the Third Prince are dashed as well.

406
00:27:23,640-->00:27:25,599
It is utterly intolerable.

407
00:27:26,400-->00:27:27,999
Give it to me.

408
00:27:32,640-->00:27:34,359
Yunli.

409
00:27:34,440-->00:27:37,520
The birthday celebration for our late Imperial Father is now finished.

410
00:27:38,839-->00:27:42,920
Whenever I recall the times when our Imperial Father lived

411
00:27:42,999-->00:27:45,839
and the guidance he gave the both of us,

412
00:27:46,559-->00:27:48,599
I have always felt sorrowful.

413
00:27:49,760-->00:27:51,359
But were our father here today,

414
00:27:53,400-->00:27:55,839
were he to see you married and expecting a child so soon,

415
00:27:55,920-->00:27:56,920
MENG JINGXIAN

416
00:27:57,999-->00:27:59,520
he would truly be gratified.

417
00:28:01,240-->00:28:04,479
Everything I have was given by Your Majesty's grace.

418
00:28:12,760-->00:28:15,0
Your little cousin is within my belly.

419
00:28:15,679-->00:28:18,880
-Sixth Prince, do you like him? -I want a girl cousin.

420
00:28:21,160-->00:28:22,960
My lord, what do you think?

421
00:28:23,799-->00:28:24,800
Very well.

422
00:28:27,719-->00:28:29,880
Hongyan, come to your mother for soup.

423
00:28:29,959-->00:28:32,400
Don't bother Secondary Princess Consort Xian.

424
00:28:32,480-->00:28:35,399
I want Auntie to feed me.

425
00:28:35,480-->00:28:38,479
Fine. I will feed you, good boy.

426
00:28:39,880-->00:28:44,320
Hongyan is still young, yet he likes Xian's baby very much.

427
00:28:44,400-->00:28:46,240
It appears they have been brought together by fate.

428
00:28:46,319-->00:28:48,959
They are cousins, of course they are together by fate.

429
00:29:03,79-->00:29:04,599
Jingxian.

430
00:29:04,679-->00:29:06,959
Jingxian, what's the matter? Jingxian!

431
00:29:07,39-->00:29:08,479
Imperial doctor!

432
00:29:08,560-->00:29:11,640
What happened? She was well just a moment ago.

433
00:29:11,720-->00:29:13,839
It appears she has been poisoned.

434
00:29:14,359-->00:29:17,439
The food is poisoned! Imperial guards, protect His Majesty!

435
00:29:18,799-->00:29:22,479
Your Majesty, if Xian has been poisoned, you'd best return to Yangxin Hall at once.

436
00:29:22,559-->00:29:25,239
-Your Majesty. -I shall not leave.

437
00:29:26,960-->00:29:30,0
I must stay to discover who could be so audacious

438
00:29:30,79-->00:29:32,119
as to carry out an assassination in my presence.

439
00:29:42,440-->00:29:43,800
It is crane's red crown.

440
00:29:45,880-->00:29:47,239
Crane's red crown?

441
00:29:47,319-->00:29:49,560
That's not good. The child is already mature.

442
00:29:49,640-->00:29:51,439
Quickly, prepare the medicine to hasten delivery.

443
00:29:51,520-->00:29:53,719
-My lord. -Go! Hurry up!

444
00:29:53,799-->00:29:56,920
Your Majesty, Secondary Princess Consort Xian has been poisoned.

445
00:29:56,999-->00:29:59,680
What was the last thing she ate?

446
00:30:00,440-->00:30:02,239
Your Majesty,

447
00:30:02,319-->00:30:04,519
Secondary Princess Consort Xian tasted the Sixth Prince's soup.

448
00:30:13,920-->00:30:16,559
The silver needle has turned black. This bowl of soup is poisonous.

449
00:30:17,200-->00:30:18,200
Check this one as well.

450
00:30:23,799-->00:30:24,800
This one is poisonous as well.

451
00:30:28,599-->00:30:33,0
Your Majesty, someone intended to kill Hongyan and myself.

452
00:30:33,79-->00:30:34,319
Xian was simply caught in between.

453
00:30:35,680-->00:30:38,799
Investigate at once!

454
00:30:39,359-->00:30:40,359
Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:30:41,479-->00:30:42,880
My lord.

456
00:30:45,720-->00:30:46,799
My lord.

457
00:30:47,800-->00:30:50,919
It was I who plied you with drink.

458
00:30:51,720-->00:30:53,999
That is how our child was conceived.

459
00:30:54,80-->00:30:55,599
Do not speak of it now.

460
00:30:56,200-->00:30:57,880
I am by your side.

461
00:30:57,960-->00:30:59,840
I will always remain by your side.

462
00:30:59,920-->00:31:03,119
The maid who served the soup to Noble Consort Xi and the Sixth Prince

463
00:31:03,200-->00:31:05,760
states that on her way she crossed paths with Jianqiu of Jingren Palace.

464
00:31:05,839-->00:31:09,839
Jianqiu opened the lid of the food box and asked what was inside.

465
00:31:09,919-->00:31:12,199
Aside from her, no other is suspicious.

466
00:31:12,279-->00:31:13,800
I have brought Jianqiu here.

467
00:31:13,880-->00:31:16,199
-Bring her here. -Yes, Your Majesty.

468
00:31:19,999-->00:31:21,599
Was it the Empress?

469
00:31:23,279-->00:31:27,279
The Empress remains confined. She knew nothing of this.

470
00:31:27,359-->00:31:29,400
I planned it on my own.

471
00:31:35,559-->00:31:37,319
She is going to commit suicide.

472
00:31:39,960-->00:31:43,839
Your Majesty, why didn't you trust Her Highness the Empress?

473
00:31:44,959-->00:31:47,119
She is your wife. She has truly loved you.

474
00:31:47,200-->00:31:49,479
Take her to the Office of Punishment for interrogation by torture.

475
00:31:49,560-->00:31:51,880
She must be forced to tell the truth.

476
00:31:51,959-->00:31:52,999
Take her away!

477
00:31:53,79-->00:31:56,839
Noble Consort Xi, aren't you afraid of being punished in the end?

478
00:31:56,920-->00:31:59,39
Fate will bring you to a miserable end!

479
00:31:59,119-->00:32:03,119
Noble Consort Xi, you are a vile wretch!

480
00:32:06,559-->00:32:10,120
Your Majesty, it is a baby boy.

481
00:32:10,200-->00:32:13,159
Yet Secondary Princess Consort Xian was so weakened by her labor

482
00:32:13,239-->00:32:15,760
that she was unable to endure the poison and has expired.

483
00:32:28,760-->00:32:29,919
All has been confessed.

484
00:32:30,880-->00:32:32,999
In addition to the plot on Noble Consort Xi,

485
00:32:33,79-->00:32:35,359
much more was revealed.

486
00:32:35,440-->00:32:37,279
I dare not hide it from Your Majesty.

487
00:32:38,279-->00:32:39,319
What is it?

488
00:32:42,439-->00:32:46,200
Your Majesty, it concerns the cause of Empress Chunyuan's death.

489
00:32:49,640-->00:32:51,40
It is linked to the Empress.

490
00:32:52,239-->00:32:53,440
Impudence!

491
00:32:54,559-->00:32:56,39
I dare not lie.

492
00:33:03,359-->00:33:06,599
Speak. Spare me no detail.

493
00:33:07,119-->00:33:10,160
Your Majesty, I have consulted the imperial doctors.

494
00:33:10,240-->00:33:14,400
They say the plantain is of cold nature. Normally, eating a little causes no harm.

495
00:33:14,480-->00:33:18,319
But a woman who carries a child should not consume any.

496
00:33:18,399-->00:33:21,919
Because the plantain has the same effect as peach stone and safflower,

497
00:33:22,0-->00:33:24,120
it can unblock the blood and relieve swelling.

498
00:33:24,200-->00:33:26,719
The effect is not as strong as safflower.

499
00:33:27,320-->00:33:32,840
Yet if steamed together with other foods, its properties may infiltrate that food.

500
00:33:32,920-->00:33:35,479
After many exposures, it may be harmful to health.

501
00:33:35,559-->00:33:37,880
Besides, an ingredient of the almond milk tea

502
00:33:37,959-->00:33:40,399
was also replaced by peach stone, which is harmful to the fetus.

503
00:33:40,999-->00:33:44,559
Since it was blended into the tea, it was difficult to recognize by taste.

504
00:33:44,639-->00:33:46,840
All of these ingredients

505
00:33:46,920-->00:33:51,199
had always been slipped into the food of Empress Chunyuan.

506
00:33:52,720-->00:33:55,120
Did the servants admit this with their own mouths?

507
00:33:55,200-->00:33:57,759
Jianqiu was mercilessly tortured, yet she didn't say a word.

508
00:33:58,400-->00:34:02,399
However, Jiang Fuhai has confessed to everything.

509
00:34:06,760-->00:34:10,880
At such a juncture, do you admit your own guilt?

510
00:34:12,360-->00:34:14,680
Your Majesty, since you already believe it is so,

511
00:34:14,760-->00:34:17,79
why bother to ask?

512
00:34:17,159-->00:34:21,0
Were I not obliged to hear your confession myself

513
00:34:21,760-->00:34:25,199
do you think I would willingly look upon your face?

514
00:34:29,400-->00:34:34,79
This pair of jade bracelets was given to me when I married you.

515
00:34:34,719-->00:34:37,519
You personally placed them on my wrists.

516
00:34:38,119-->00:34:39,120
At the time,

517
00:34:40,79-->00:34:44,0
you took this bracelet in hand and told me

518
00:34:45,0-->00:34:47,199
if I should someday give birth to a son,

519
00:34:47,280-->00:34:50,320
I would become your primary spouse.

520
00:34:51,919-->00:34:54,559
Yet when I did give birth to a son,

521
00:34:55,239-->00:34:57,800
you had already married my sister as your primary spouse.

522
00:34:59,440-->00:35:03,840
Even my son was forced to accept the rank of a concubine's son.

523
00:35:03,920-->00:35:05,760
Just as I did,

524
00:35:05,840-->00:35:08,840
he endured scorn as the child of a concubine.

525
00:35:08,920-->00:35:11,79
How could you truly understand

526
00:35:11,159-->00:35:14,40
how hard it is to be the child of a concubine?

527
00:35:14,119-->00:35:16,760
It is precisely because I understood

528
00:35:16,840-->00:35:19,239
that I have treated you well since we married.

529
00:35:20,79-->00:35:22,760
Even though Chunyuan was my only primary spouse,

530
00:35:22,840-->00:35:25,280
I made you my secondary spouse, second only to her.

531
00:35:25,360-->00:35:27,679
Chunyuan was your own sister.

532
00:35:27,760-->00:35:29,519
Were you not afraid of the consequences?

533
00:35:29,599-->00:35:31,480
During the nighttime,

534
00:35:31,559-->00:35:33,360
had you no fear that Chunyuan and her child

535
00:35:33,439-->00:35:35,39
would haunt you and claim your life?

536
00:35:35,119-->00:35:38,559
If she wanted to claim my life, she could have just come for me.

537
00:35:38,639-->00:35:41,920
But during the long nights,

538
00:35:42,0-->00:35:45,800
the incessant crying of my own child haunted my dreams.

539
00:35:46,719-->00:35:50,840
At the moment I lost my own child, my sister learned that she was expecting.

540
00:35:51,519-->00:35:54,559
Your Majesty, you were overjoyed by my sister's pregnancy

541
00:35:54,639-->00:35:58,239
and had already forgotten our own child.

542
00:35:59,719-->00:36:02,480
He was less than three years old.

543
00:36:02,560-->00:36:05,800
His body was scalding hot with fever.

544
00:36:05,879-->00:36:08,320
He died from an incurable illness.

545
00:36:12,920-->00:36:15,599
Unexpectedly, my sister conceived at the very same time.

546
00:36:15,679-->00:36:18,239
Was it not her son that claimed my son's life?

547
00:36:18,320-->00:36:22,239
How could I allow her son to become the Crown Prince?

548
00:36:22,319-->00:36:23,320
What madness.

549
00:36:24,239-->00:36:26,800
It was I who insisted on marrying Chunyuan.

550
00:36:26,880-->00:36:29,280
It was I who took her as my primary spouse.

551
00:36:29,360-->00:36:31,280
It was I who conceived a child with her.

552
00:36:31,359-->00:36:33,800
Why did you not hate me instead?

553
00:36:34,920-->00:36:36,919
You think I didn't want to hate you?

554
00:36:40,840-->00:36:43,119
But I could not.

555
00:36:43,800-->00:36:46,440
I truly could not.

556
00:36:47,239-->00:36:49,639
You only cared for my sister.

557
00:36:50,879-->00:36:53,280
Your Majesty, did you ever know

558
00:36:53,359-->00:36:57,560
that my love for you was no less than your love for my sister?

559
00:36:59,959-->00:37:02,439
Every woman who truly loves her husband

560
00:37:03,39-->00:37:05,879
could never bear to watch her beloved husband

561
00:37:05,960-->00:37:08,800
fall in love and have a child with another woman.

562
00:37:10,719-->00:37:12,679
I cannot bear it.

563
00:37:13,79-->00:37:15,880
I truly cannot bear it.

564
00:37:16,480-->00:37:18,599
Though you think I am spiteful and jealous,

565
00:37:19,879-->00:37:24,559
I am the one who has loved you most truly.

566
00:37:24,639-->00:37:27,360
That is why I have acted in this way.

567
00:37:28,119-->00:37:30,119
Honeyed words but evil intent.

568
00:37:30,920-->00:37:33,280
You truly disgust me.

569
00:37:34,639-->00:37:40,199
The Empress, descended from the Ula Nara clan,

570
00:37:41,39-->00:37:44,480
has not been blessed by heaven, and is utterly deceitful.

571
00:37:45,880-->00:37:49,719
She harmed imperial heirs and conspired with imperial officials.

572
00:37:50,440-->00:37:52,919
She is unsuitable to be a member of the

573
00:37:52,999-->00:37:54,639
royal family, a model mother to the nation.

574
00:37:55,520-->00:37:58,960
Thus, she will be demoted to the status of a commoner

575
00:38:00,159-->00:38:01,199
and sent to the Cold Palace.

576
00:38:02,79-->00:38:04,79
-Su Peisheng. -Your Majesty.

577
00:38:04,159-->00:38:06,0
Announce my decree to the harem.

578
00:38:06,79-->00:38:07,680
She and I

579
00:38:09,440-->00:38:11,479
shall never meet again in this lifetime nor in death.

580
00:38:11,560-->00:38:13,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

581
00:38:22,280-->00:38:23,280
Your Majesty,

582
00:38:23,359-->00:38:27,0
Moge Khan of the Dzungar Mongols is overweening and ambitious.

583
00:38:27,79-->00:38:29,0
He is moving towards Yanming Pass with a cavalry of 400,000.

584
00:38:29,79-->00:38:31,80
Once Yanming Pass is occupied by the enemy,

585
00:38:31,159-->00:38:33,560
the capital will be placed in a critical situation.

586
00:38:34,600-->00:38:37,480
The Dzungar Mongols are nothing more than a tribe of the steppes.

587
00:38:38,320-->00:38:40,719
Even they dare to challenge me now.

588
00:38:40,799-->00:38:43,719
If we must appoint another capable general at this moment,

589
00:38:43,800-->00:38:46,760
it will probably prove quite difficult.

590
00:38:46,840-->00:38:50,840
It is easier to raise an army of thousands than it is to find one good general.

591
00:38:50,919-->00:38:55,39
For a leader to send to the battlefront, the Imperial Dukes are the best choice.

592
00:38:55,920-->00:38:57,760
After careful consideration,

593
00:38:58,400-->00:39:01,39
I believe Marquess Guo is the best choice.

594
00:39:01,120-->00:39:03,599
Marquess Guo has always known his place.

595
00:39:04,519-->00:39:08,920
Your Majesty, you have considered every detail. Most admirable.

596
00:39:08,999-->00:39:10,520
He is fond of poetry and literature.

597
00:39:11,119-->00:39:15,599
It matters not if I promote him to duke and grant him undeserved recognition.

598
00:39:15,679-->00:39:18,79
It is the skilled generals that must be chosen with care.

599
00:39:18,160-->00:39:19,960
I understand.

600
00:39:20,39-->00:39:23,159
Once the situation at the battlefront becomes somewhat stable,

601
00:39:23,239-->00:39:26,320
we shall send him to guard Yanming Pass.

602
00:39:27,199-->00:39:28,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

603
00:40:03,560-->00:40:08,959
Flowers in blossom and the full moon, symbols of a conjugal bliss which endures.

604
00:40:11,239-->00:40:13,599
Flowers in blossom and the full moon are easy to attain.

605
00:40:14,480-->00:40:17,239
Yet lovers' moments together do not endure.

606
00:40:18,840-->00:40:22,280
Huan, at this very moment,

607
00:40:23,119-->00:40:27,439
I hope you are enjoying peace and happiness beneath this moonlight.

608
00:40:29,480-->00:40:31,920
Are these letters authentic?

609
00:40:32,520-->00:40:34,600
Have you confirmed that the handwriting is his?

610
00:40:34,679-->00:40:36,159
Yes, I have.

611
00:40:36,239-->00:40:37,999
When I greeted Secondary Princess Consort Yu,

612
00:40:38,80-->00:40:42,39
I took them from the lowest drawer of her dressing table.

613
00:40:43,640-->00:40:44,800
Are they all here?

614
00:40:44,880-->00:40:46,120
I was afraid they would be noticed missing.

615
00:40:46,199-->00:40:47,760
Thus, I only took a few.

616
00:40:54,960-->00:40:57,199
How fares Duke Guo?

617
00:40:57,280-->00:41:00,800
Your Majesty, Duke Guo has guarded Yanming Pass for three years.

618
00:41:00,880-->00:41:03,280
During this time, the Dzungars have not launched a single attack.

619
00:41:03,360-->00:41:04,439
He guards the borderlands and

620
00:41:04,519-->00:41:06,40
commands the troops with strict discipline.

621
00:41:06,119-->00:41:08,280
He drinks with and bunks beside his generals and soldiers.

622
00:41:08,359-->00:41:10,880
Despite his high status, he is not haughty or imperious.

623
00:41:11,479-->00:41:14,119
The generals and soldiers respect and support him to the last man.

624
00:41:14,199-->00:41:16,719
So he hopes to purchase popular support.

625
00:41:17,399-->00:41:19,639
I have already read his memorandum.

626
00:41:19,719-->00:41:23,480
He writes, "The breezes of spring have not yet arrived at Yumen Pass."

627
00:41:23,559-->00:41:26,600
He describes life in the borderlands as very harsh.

628
00:41:26,679-->00:41:30,599
He suggests that we show consideration for the soldiers and the populace there

629
00:41:30,679-->00:41:32,360
and recommence frontier trade

630
00:41:33,439-->00:41:36,719
so the people of the borderlands may live in prosperity and contentment.

631
00:41:37,440-->00:41:41,119
Duke Guo's opinion is most reasonable.

632
00:41:41,199-->00:41:44,400
No matter how reasonable, his opinion is unnecessary.

633
00:41:45,760-->00:41:47,760
I ordered him to guard the borderlands,

634
00:41:47,840-->00:41:49,560
not to interfere with the affairs of state.

635
00:41:50,400-->00:41:53,280
Your Majesty, please do not stoke your anger.

636
00:41:53,359-->00:41:55,760
You are taking the remedy prescribed by the imperial doctors.

637
00:41:55,840-->00:41:58,479
You must not indulge your anger while taking it.

638
00:42:01,80-->00:42:02,880
Three years have passed.

639
00:42:05,280-->00:42:07,519
Summon him back to the capital to report on his mission.

640
00:42:07,599-->00:42:08,999
Yes, Your Majesty.

641
00:42:16,280-->00:42:18,280
Your Majesty, Noble Consort Xi is here.

642
00:42:19,159-->00:42:21,559
Your Majesty, may blessings and peace be with you.

643
00:42:22,599-->00:42:24,199
You are here.

644
00:42:26,679-->00:42:29,0
-You may retire now. -Yes, my lady.

645
00:42:36,760-->00:42:39,39
Your forehead is covered with sweat.

646
00:42:53,320-->00:42:55,679
That is the first time I've struck you since you came to the palace.

647
00:42:57,479-->00:43:00,760
If Your Majesty intends to strike me, then I must bear it.

648
00:43:02,320-->00:43:07,80
However, please instruct me on what I have done wrong.

649
00:43:07,159-->00:43:08,760
Instruct you?

650
00:43:09,679-->00:43:12,479
Yunli has returned. You must be quite content.

651
00:43:12,560-->00:43:15,719
I only feel content for Huanbi.

652
00:43:15,800-->00:43:19,439
Was it you or Huanbi who longed for Yunli's return?

653
00:43:19,519-->00:43:21,199
You know full well in your heart.

654
00:43:22,719-->00:43:26,280
Since we were children, Imperial Father always loved Yunli most.

655
00:43:26,880-->00:43:28,320
If not for the objections of the officials,

656
00:43:28,400-->00:43:31,800
another man would be sitting on this throne.

657
00:43:32,999-->00:43:35,360
Now he leads the troops by my decree.

658
00:43:35,440-->00:43:39,440
If he harbors disloyal intentions, just as Duke Dun once did...

659
00:43:41,760-->00:43:46,359
-I cannot help but be wary of him. -Your Majesty, Duke Guo would never...

660
00:43:46,440-->00:43:48,840
How can you know what thoughts run through his mind?

661
00:43:49,719-->00:43:54,280
I always knew he harbored improper thoughts for you.

662
00:43:55,880-->00:43:56,920
I dare not think it.

663
00:43:57,960-->00:43:59,919
Proper relations between the Emperor and his

664
00:44:00,0-->00:44:02,199
officials come before bonds of fraternity.

665
00:44:02,800-->00:44:05,679
If the Emperor orders an official to die, he has no choice but to do so.

666
00:44:06,239-->00:44:07,360
Your Majesty.

667
00:44:09,920-->00:44:11,960
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

668
00:44:12,840-->00:44:16,239
Duke Guo is of great military merit and has never made an error.

669
00:44:17,719-->00:44:19,439
If Your Majesty intends to dispose of him,

670
00:44:19,519-->00:44:22,280
I'm afraid it will tarnish your reputation.

671
00:44:36,640-->00:44:40,760
You have never failed to carry out my instructions.

672
00:44:42,119-->00:44:44,119
Therefore, at this time,

673
00:44:44,199-->00:44:46,999
I intend to entrust you with another task.

674
00:44:49,239-->00:44:51,599
I must dispose of Yunli.

675
00:44:53,760-->00:44:56,560
I simply offer you the chance

676
00:44:57,320-->00:45:00,880
to prove to me by your actions

677
00:45:00,959-->00:45:03,479
that you do not harbor improper thoughts for him.

678
00:45:11,679-->00:45:15,360
-I greet Your Majesty. -Your Grace, it is Noble Consort Xi.

679
00:45:16,880-->00:45:18,679
His Majesty asked me to meet him here.

680
00:45:18,760-->00:45:22,680
His Majesty drank overmuch, so he asked Noble Consort Xi to come first.

681
00:45:22,760-->00:45:25,239
His Majesty will come after he bathes and changes.

682
00:45:26,600-->00:45:28,840
So I must trouble you again, Noble Consort Xi.

683
00:45:28,919-->00:45:30,760
No need for such courtesy, Your Grace.

684
00:45:41,760-->00:45:44,360
This fine wine was sent by His Majesty.

685
00:45:44,959-->00:45:47,39
My lady, please accompany the Duke.

686
00:45:47,120-->00:45:49,639
I will escort His Majesty here.

687
00:46:00,360-->00:46:03,119
I seldom have the chance to drink with the Duke.

688
00:46:03,719-->00:46:06,640
Just as in the past. It is summer once again.

689
00:46:07,400-->00:46:09,760
You still like to dress in light pink.

690
00:46:14,0-->00:46:15,519
Your Grace,

691
00:46:16,440-->00:46:18,439
over these years,

692
00:46:19,760-->00:46:21,880
you have suffered greatly in the borderlands.

693
00:46:24,679-->00:46:27,360
Noble Consort Xi, have you ever heard this saying?

694
00:46:28,599-->00:46:30,319
"Yearning for a life long in years,

695
00:46:31,320-->00:46:34,320
"we share the same moonlight even a thousand miles apart."

696
00:46:35,719-->00:46:38,80
As long as my heart knows that this shared moonlight

697
00:46:38,999-->00:46:41,639
also shines for another who lives in peace and health,

698
00:46:42,879-->00:46:45,559
then it doesn't matter in what straits I find myself.

699
00:46:51,199-->00:46:55,960
The best days of my life were the ones we shared at Mount Lingyun.

700
00:47:06,0-->00:47:07,280
Then tonight,

701
00:47:08,320-->00:47:10,719
allow me to indulge myself just this once.

702
00:47:21,760-->00:47:24,800
There is a draft. Please close the window first.

703
00:47:43,559-->00:47:47,920
Look at the decoration on the window. Does it not suit the occasion well?

704
00:47:48,840-->00:47:50,840
It is a drawing of silk tree flowers.

705
00:47:52,639-->00:47:57,159
Do such brilliant colors not recall the decorations of a wedding ceremony?

706
00:48:00,80-->00:48:02,120
Mother was fond of silk tree flowers.

707
00:48:03,79-->00:48:06,40
When they built Tung Blossom Terrace, Imperial Father ordered

708
00:48:06,119-->00:48:08,480
that all the windows be decorated with this flower.

709
00:48:09,199-->00:48:14,320
Silk tree flowers represent tenderness and everlasting love.

710
00:48:15,40-->00:48:18,639
Didn't silk trees use to grow all around Ninghui Hall?

711
00:48:19,560-->00:48:21,959
Two hearts united as one bring true joy.

712
00:48:23,639-->00:48:27,560
It's a pity that no matter how deeply Imperial Father loved Mother,

713
00:48:28,640-->00:48:30,840
he could never remain by her side alone.

714
00:48:32,880-->00:48:34,600
Nor can I.

715
00:48:36,440-->00:48:38,239
I pity Jingxian.

716
00:48:39,159-->00:48:40,840
I pity Huanbi.

717
00:48:44,440-->00:48:46,480
But I have even greater pity for you.

718
00:48:47,280-->00:48:48,960
Don't say such sad words.

719
00:48:49,39-->00:48:52,80
I fear if I do not say so now, I will not have another chance.

720
00:48:52,159-->00:48:54,440
-Nonsense! -Isn't it true?

721
00:48:58,0-->00:49:00,239
Let us not speak of such things.

722
00:49:08,559-->00:49:10,399
Then I will say,

723
00:49:11,719-->00:49:15,599
"Let us commit ourselves to one another for life, two souls eternally united."

724
00:49:24,359-->00:49:27,119
“If only we may live in harmonious matrimony,

725
00:49:27,199-->00:49:29,440
"our days filled with peace and joy.”

726
00:49:39,80-->00:49:41,439
Look, I have emptied my cup.

727
00:49:58,879-->00:50:01,239
Let this wine seal our wedlock.

728
00:50:02,760-->00:50:04,360
I did not leave a single drop.

729
00:50:06,440-->00:50:08,80
I want to tell you something.

730
00:50:09,280-->00:50:13,760
Now that I have lived out this moment in my life,

731
00:50:14,840-->00:50:17,439
I have no regrets at all.

732
00:50:24,159-->00:50:26,119
Let me hold you in my arms again.

733
00:50:37,959-->00:50:40,719
Hongyan was very naughty as a small child,

734
00:50:41,439-->00:50:43,360
yet very clever.

735
00:50:44,360-->00:50:46,80
Unlike Lingxi,

736
00:50:46,999-->00:50:48,639
who was self-possessed from the start.

737
00:50:50,600-->00:50:52,519
One is active, the other quiet.

738
00:50:53,119-->00:50:56,79
They do not seem twins at all.

739
00:50:59,440-->00:51:00,440
Yunli.

740
00:51:00,519-->00:51:02,599
Yunli, what is it?

741
00:51:04,679-->00:51:08,599
A jug that contains two wines, one poisoned, the other unpoisoned.

742
00:51:09,399-->00:51:10,999
I know His Majesty well.

743
00:51:11,839-->00:51:14,440
He allowed you to come alone after nightfall.

744
00:51:14,519-->00:51:16,480
I knew it was unusual.

745
00:51:17,79-->00:51:19,200
When you left the table to close the window,

746
00:51:21,199-->00:51:23,119
I exchanged our cups.

747
00:51:23,199-->00:51:24,559
Huan.

748
00:51:26,839-->00:51:28,599
I had to spare you this difficult task.

749
00:51:30,159-->00:51:32,520
My fate was sealed long ago.

750
00:51:34,920-->00:51:36,559
His Majesty intends that I die.

751
00:51:37,719-->00:51:39,800
How could I remain alive?

752
00:51:39,880-->00:51:41,280
Don't leave me.

753
00:51:41,360-->00:51:44,480
I am your wife. Take me away from the palace.

754
00:51:44,559-->00:51:46,880
I don't want to stay here.

755
00:51:46,959-->00:51:48,679
In my heart,

756
00:51:50,199-->00:51:55,160
you have always been my one, true...

757
00:51:57,439-->00:52:00,959
wife.

758
00:52:10,679-->00:52:13,159
I never told you

759
00:52:14,280-->00:52:16,559
that Hongyan and Lingxi

760
00:52:17,999-->00:52:20,159
are both yours.

761
00:52:39,559-->00:52:40,599
My lady, you have emerged.

762
00:52:47,120-->00:52:48,679
By secret imperial edict,

763
00:52:48,760-->00:52:52,239
if my lady should emerge, then I am to deliver another edict.

764
00:52:52,319-->00:52:55,599
If, besides my lady, another should emerge as well,

765
00:52:55,679-->00:52:57,679
then I am to kill the both of you on sight.

766
00:52:59,719-->00:53:04,0
I am safe and well and have already emerged.

767
00:53:05,400-->00:53:08,119
-Then... -Duke Guo

768
00:53:09,359-->00:53:10,360
is dead.

769
00:53:14,959-->00:53:17,280
Eunuch, please read the imperial edict.

770
00:53:20,760-->00:53:23,199
Noble Consort Xi, kneel to receive the decree.

771
00:53:26,760-->00:53:29,360
By the grace of heaven, the Emperor hereby decrees

772
00:53:29,440-->00:53:32,880
that the Empress has misbehaved, leaving the harem leaderless.

773
00:53:32,960-->00:53:34,479
Therefore, we appoint Noble Consort Xi

774
00:53:34,560-->00:53:36,519
to take charge of the harem for the present.

775
00:53:36,599-->00:53:38,599
Her status will be that of a Secondary Empress.

776
00:53:38,679-->00:53:40,480
Issued by His Imperial Majesty.

777
00:53:41,600-->00:53:45,80
My lady, this is an unprecedented elevation.

778
00:53:52,519-->00:53:54,679
His Majesty knew you would be tired.

779
00:53:54,760-->00:53:57,879
He especially instructed me to escort you to your residence for rest.

780
00:54:22,559-->00:54:25,360
I want my father, I want...

781
00:54:25,439-->00:54:28,400
Do not cry. It is forbidden.

782
00:54:29,840-->00:54:32,199
Madam, it is owing to His Majesty's mercy

783
00:54:32,280-->00:54:34,159
that your private mourning has been allowed.

784
00:54:34,239-->00:54:36,519
Nevertheless, he has decreed that no lamentations must be heard.

785
00:54:39,320-->00:54:41,880
His Majesty has unrighteously harmed his own brother.

786
00:54:41,960-->00:54:45,519
Of course he allows no one to speak of it. Even crying out is forbidden.

787
00:54:45,599-->00:54:48,960
Never say such words, madam. It is greatly disrespectful.

788
00:54:51,280-->00:54:53,999
What should a person like me be frightened of?

789
00:55:01,320-->00:55:04,39
It is time now. Move the coffin.

790
00:55:13,119-->00:55:14,599
Madam.

791
00:55:26,560-->00:55:29,800
Yunli, don't leave me behind!

792
00:55:32,960-->00:55:34,0
Madam!

793
00:55:36,79-->00:55:37,480
Madam!

794
00:55:40,719-->00:55:42,519
Madam!

795
00:55:43,119-->00:55:44,719
Madam!

796
00:55:47,520-->00:55:50,519
Mantra of Rebirth in The Pure Land

797
00:55:55,599-->00:55:58,960
-My lady, Su Peisheng is here. -My lady.

798
00:56:00,239-->00:56:01,800
What is it?

799
00:56:01,880-->00:56:03,920
My lady, you must contain your grief.

800
00:56:07,719-->00:56:09,520
Huanbi has followed Duke Guo and passed away.

801
00:56:17,719-->00:56:20,320
-My lady. -My lady, do not despair.

802
00:56:23,40-->00:56:25,679
His Majesty has been moved by her devotion.

803
00:56:25,760-->00:56:27,360
She will be honored as Primary Spouse

804
00:56:27,439-->00:56:30,840
and buried together with Duke Guo in the borderlands by imperial edict.

805
00:56:40,439-->00:56:42,400
What of Yuanche?

806
00:56:42,479-->00:56:44,159
As he is young, His Majesty says he is

807
00:56:44,239-->00:56:46,280
to be raised by Marquess Shen and his wife.

808
00:56:48,760-->00:56:52,280
Duke Guo died so suddenly. His Majesty is sorely grieved

809
00:56:52,360-->00:56:55,920
and was forced to keep his death hidden to prevent others from talking about it.

810
00:56:55,999-->00:56:58,360
He has grown gaunt over the last several days.

811
00:57:00,119-->00:57:03,520
-Advise him to contain his grief. -Yes, my lady.

812
00:57:07,40-->00:57:11,39
There is something I need you to investigate for me.

813
00:57:11,679-->00:57:13,679
My lady, I am at your service.

814
00:57:15,400-->00:57:17,199
Why was His Majesty

815
00:57:18,239-->00:57:21,800
obliged to kill Duke Guo so suddenly?

816
00:57:23,119-->00:57:24,719
It appears it was on account of some letters.

817
00:57:26,880-->00:57:28,320
Letters?

818
00:57:29,599-->00:57:31,440
"Wish Noble Consort Xi well."

819
00:57:32,920-->00:57:34,320
"Wish Noble Consort Xi well."

820
00:57:34,920-->00:57:36,400
"Wish Noble Consort Xi well."

821
00:57:37,80-->00:57:38,719
"Wish Noble Consort Xi well."

822
00:57:39,679-->00:57:41,280
"Wish Noble Consort Xi well."

823
00:57:41,880-->00:57:46,320
This phrase was written at the end of every letter he sent home.

824
00:57:48,199-->00:57:49,600
Jinxi.

825
00:57:51,239-->00:57:52,840
It was on every letter.

826
00:57:56,560-->00:57:59,360
It showed that Duke Guo had deep concern for you, my lady.

827
00:58:00,999-->00:58:03,280
That's what led to his death.

828
00:58:07,199-->00:58:10,79
How did His Majesty come to possess these letters?

829
00:58:11,280-->00:58:12,600
Xia Yi.

830
00:58:13,199-->00:58:15,760
Xia Yi is the leader of an organization called the Cicada Removal Service.

831
00:58:15,840-->00:58:17,439
They are assassins, known as the Guillotines.

832
00:58:17,520-->00:58:19,760
They secretly pore over affairs of state

833
00:58:19,839-->00:58:21,640
and purge all opposing voices to His Majesty.

834
00:58:22,760-->00:58:24,520
So that is what it was.

835
00:58:30,360-->00:58:32,679
-I greet Noble Consort Xi. -You may rise.

836
00:58:33,719-->00:58:35,840
I just passed by Ninghui Hall

837
00:58:35,919-->00:58:39,840
and saw the eunuchs cutting down all the silk trees by imperial decree.

838
00:58:40,480-->00:58:45,80
His Majesty found it discordant that their flowers fall in late autumn.

839
00:58:46,39-->00:58:48,960
His Majesty could not even bear the sight of those silk trees.

840
00:58:49,600-->00:58:52,199
Yet I think His Majesty is right.

841
00:58:52,280-->00:58:55,679
As their owner is no longer here, they may as well be cut down.

842
00:59:02,199-->00:59:03,599
Those silk tree flowers

843
00:59:03,679-->00:59:05,879
were planted by Yunli as a gift to celebrate

844
00:59:05,960-->00:59:07,840
your conferment as Noble Consort.

845
00:59:09,800-->00:59:12,39
I was afraid you would be distressed over this.

846
00:59:13,400-->00:59:16,559
So I told His Majesty that I do not sleep well at night

847
00:59:17,280-->00:59:19,800
and need to keep those silk tree flowers for medicinal use.

848
00:59:20,640-->00:59:23,239
Fortunately, His Majesty agreed.

849
00:59:24,120-->00:59:28,360
He ordered someone to replant the silk trees at my palace.

850
00:59:28,440-->00:59:29,719
I appreciate that.

851
00:59:31,480-->00:59:34,600
Then don't let him off easily.

852
00:59:37,639-->00:59:39,39
No hurry.

853
00:59:39,960-->00:59:41,839
Your Majesty,

854
00:59:41,920-->00:59:44,40
even though you are still young and healthy,

855
00:59:44,119-->00:59:46,400
a Crown Prince must be selected without delay.

856
00:59:47,120-->00:59:51,40
Among the imperial heirs, the Fourth Prince is the eldest.

857
00:59:51,119-->00:59:54,39
I suggest that the Fourth Prince be selected as Crown Prince

858
00:59:54,120-->00:59:56,600
and let him share responsibility for affairs of state with Your Majesty.

859
00:59:58,79-->01:0:2,560
The Crown Princes of this dynasty have never been selected according to age.

860
01:0:2,639-->01:0:4,879
Virtue and talent is all that matters.

861
01:0:6,40-->01:0:7,480
Your Majesty,

862
01:0:7,559-->01:0:10,719
the Fourth Prince has been raised outside the palace and not much educated.

863
01:0:10,799-->01:0:15,319
Among the imperial heirs, I find the Sixth Prince most intelligent.

864
01:0:15,400-->01:0:16,599
Your Majesty,

865
01:0:17,280-->01:0:19,79
though the Sixth Prince is intelligent,

866
01:0:19,159-->01:0:20,960
he is still young and his mother is in her prime.

867
01:0:21,40-->01:0:22,719
Should Noble Consort Xi become Empress Dowager,

868
01:0:22,800-->01:0:25,760
she will control the court and the state will fall into a woman's hands.

869
01:0:26,479-->01:0:28,0
I hope the Crown Prince will be selected rightly.

870
01:0:28,79-->01:0:29,959
Your Majesty, please hear my opinion.

871
01:0:30,599-->01:0:31,760
Speak.

872
01:0:31,840-->01:0:35,360
Those who say that Hongyan is overly young and unqualified to become Crown Prince

873
01:0:35,440-->01:0:37,319
have evil thoughts in their hearts.

874
01:0:37,400-->01:0:38,599
Your Majesty, you are in good health.

875
01:0:38,679-->01:0:41,280
Why not wait until Hongyan reaches his 30s?

876
01:0:41,360-->01:0:45,400
I don't care for this point of view either.

877
01:0:46,440-->01:0:51,159
So, you still believe that our son is the best choice,

878
01:0:51,239-->01:0:52,919
do you not?

879
01:0:53,520-->01:0:55,120
Hongyan's skills are modest,

880
01:0:55,199-->01:0:57,479
not suitable for selection as Crown Prince.

881
01:0:57,560-->01:0:59,159
So in the long run,

882
01:0:59,680-->01:1:2,840
the Fourth Prince is the best choice.

883
01:1:5,79-->01:1:8,80
The Fourth Prince is not your biological son.

884
01:1:8,159-->01:1:10,399
Your Majesty, at issue is the choice of a Crown Prince,

885
01:1:10,480-->01:1:12,479
not whether he is my biological son.

886
01:1:13,440-->01:1:14,760
My return to the palace has already provoked

887
01:1:14,840-->01:1:17,320
much discussion amongst the populace.

888
01:1:17,399-->01:1:20,600
I do not wish to become the target of intrigue,

889
01:1:20,679-->01:1:24,800
forcing Your Majesty to choose between your officials and our marital affection.

890
01:1:26,119-->01:1:29,400
Mother, I bow in respect before you.

891
01:1:30,519-->01:1:31,520
You may rise.

892
01:1:33,679-->01:1:37,40
During the morning audience at court, Imperial Father conferred me as Duke Bao.

893
01:1:38,80-->01:1:39,320
It is natural.

894
01:1:39,399-->01:1:41,520
You are the eldest son, and should be first

895
01:1:41,600-->01:1:43,0
to be named Duke among the princes.

896
01:1:43,79-->01:1:45,40
Yet Hongyan has not been conferred as a Duke yet.

897
01:1:45,119-->01:1:46,719
The Sixth Prince is still young.

898
01:1:47,599-->01:1:48,719
Besides, I hope

899
01:1:49,320-->01:1:52,599
that he will be conferred as a Duke by you someday.

900
01:1:54,639-->01:1:55,840
Mother.

901
01:1:55,920-->01:1:59,400
If you understand what I mean, then you should know what to do.

902
01:2:0,639-->01:2:4,119
Don't show your emotions on your face and don't let others know your thoughts.

903
01:2:4,200-->01:2:7,199
Moreover, don't let others guess your preferences easily.

904
01:2:9,320-->01:2:14,0
We hermits wish Your Majesty a joyous birthday and a long life.

905
01:2:14,79-->01:2:16,800
To celebrate Your Majesty's birthday,

906
01:2:16,880-->01:2:20,800
my fellow disciple and I have developed another two pellets of elixir.

907
01:2:21,479-->01:2:24,39
We humbly present them to you, Your Majesty.

908
01:2:25,120-->01:2:26,239
I begin to wonder,

909
01:2:26,880-->01:2:31,199
after taking these pellets, will I truly live a long life?

910
01:2:33,479-->01:2:38,920
Your Majesty, your complexion looks much better than before.

911
01:2:41,79-->01:2:43,79
I have been by your side every day.

912
01:2:43,159-->01:2:47,280
I also notice that you are full of vigor and more energetic than before.

913
01:2:47,880-->01:2:49,280
Very well then.

914
01:2:49,360-->01:2:52,519
Your Majesty, you must not exert yourself after taking the elixir.

915
01:2:52,599-->01:2:54,399
Please remember my advice.

916
01:3:6,239-->01:3:9,399
Why have you rushed here at this late hour?

917
01:3:9,480-->01:3:14,320
My lady, Concubine Ning asked me for a certain substance this afternoon.

918
01:3:14,400-->01:3:17,280
-What kind of substance? -An aphrodisiac that stimulates desire.

919
01:3:18,840-->01:3:22,919
She enjoys His Majesty's favor now. Why did she ask for such things?

920
01:3:22,999-->01:3:25,960
Concubine Ning especially requested the incense left behind by Consort Li.

921
01:3:26,39-->01:3:27,280
Yet that matters not.

922
01:3:27,360-->01:3:30,679
More importantly, she asked for cinnabar as well.

923
01:3:30,760-->01:3:33,479
Cinnabar? What is it for?

924
01:3:33,560-->01:3:36,679
My lady, you may not know, but since His Majesty ascended the throne,

925
01:3:36,760-->01:3:40,360
he has continuously taken elixirs intended to increase his longevity.

926
01:3:40,880-->01:3:43,879
The elixir contains sulfur and mercury.

927
01:3:43,960-->01:3:47,39
Though it is just slightly poisonous, when catalyzed by cinnabar,

928
01:3:47,120-->01:3:51,79
it will appear that he grows stronger, when in fact he grows weaker within.

929
01:3:51,159-->01:3:53,239
When combined with the effect of the aphrodisiac fragrances,

930
01:3:53,320-->01:3:55,160
then his health will decline both within and without.

931
01:3:55,239-->01:3:58,640
I dare not provide Concubine Ning with cinnabar.

932
01:3:58,719-->01:4:0,960
Concubine Ning simply asked for cinnabar.

933
01:4:1,39-->01:4:3,680
Perhaps she will use it for another purpose.

934
01:4:3,760-->01:4:6,680
If you are concerned about her motives, then do not give it to her.

935
01:4:6,760-->01:4:8,439
If she truly wishes to obtain some,

936
01:4:9,239-->01:4:11,479
she will find a way to do so.

937
01:4:12,800-->01:4:14,599
Yes, I understand.

938
01:4:19,359-->01:4:22,360
BITONG STUDY HALL

939
01:4:24,719-->01:4:26,560
It is summer once again.

940
01:4:28,479-->01:4:31,639
His Majesty has been recuperating intermittently for six months now.

941
01:4:32,279-->01:4:34,799
He should be enjoying a peaceful life here in Yuanming Palace.

942
01:4:34,879-->01:4:36,519
But he has never recovered.

943
01:4:38,79-->01:4:40,319
His Majesty is concerned about affairs of state.

944
01:4:40,399-->01:4:42,880
Tell Su Peisheng to send the memoranda to His Majesty.

945
01:4:43,960-->01:4:45,720
He will surely read them.

946
01:4:46,719-->01:4:47,999
He has read every last one.

947
01:4:48,999-->01:4:51,439
However, his health has worsened considerably.

948
01:4:51,519-->01:4:55,959
How could he read dispatches for 12 or 14 hours a day as in the past?

949
01:4:57,320-->01:4:59,399
Where are Hongyan and Lingxi?

950
01:5:0,400-->01:5:1,919
Princess Lingxi went to Noble Consort Jing's residence

951
01:5:1,999-->01:5:3,840
to play with Princess Longyue.

952
01:5:4,439-->01:5:8,519
The Sixth Prince is having fun with Marquess Shen's wife in the garden.

953
01:5:10,239-->01:5:12,720
It is already summer.

954
01:5:13,919-->01:5:18,919
Why do I still feel cold inside, as if the heat was drained from my body?

955
01:5:18,999-->01:5:22,280
Your Majesty, you are quite healthy now.

956
01:5:22,360-->01:5:25,239
You have outdone yourself in the bedchamber recently.

957
01:5:25,319-->01:5:26,959
Some caution is advised.

958
01:5:28,119-->01:5:29,559
Slow down, Prince.

959
01:5:29,639-->01:5:31,520
Who is that?

960
01:5:32,279-->01:5:33,520
Slow down.

961
01:5:33,600-->01:5:36,239
Your Majesty, Marquess Shen's wife

962
01:5:36,320-->01:5:38,280
has come to the palace with the Duke's son.

963
01:5:38,360-->01:5:39,640
They are playing with the Sixth Prince.

964
01:5:40,360-->01:5:42,159
-The Duke's son? -Yes, Your Majesty.

965
01:5:42,759-->01:5:45,839
Yuanche, Yunli's son?

966
01:5:45,919-->01:5:46,919
Exactly.

967
01:5:50,199-->01:5:52,760
His Majesty the Emperor!

968
01:5:58,0-->01:6:0,119
-I greet Your Majesty. -I greet the Imperial Father.

969
01:6:0,199-->01:6:1,199
You may rise.

970
01:6:1,880-->01:6:4,119
Come here. You come too.

971
01:6:11,679-->01:6:15,880
They resemble each other. Yet Hongyan looks stronger.

972
01:6:15,960-->01:6:18,520
The Sixth Prince is older and much stronger.

973
01:6:18,600-->01:6:20,920
Yet he resembles the Duke's son very much.

974
01:6:20,999-->01:6:23,79
It's as if they were true brothers.

975
01:6:26,719-->01:6:28,320
Let me take a look.

976
01:6:29,440-->01:6:30,880
They do look alike.

977
01:6:39,719-->01:6:42,560
Especially in the eyes and the chin.

978
01:6:45,880-->01:6:48,400
Your Majesty!

979
01:6:54,120-->01:6:56,440
This concerns the imperial bloodline.

980
01:6:57,39-->01:7:1,960
This task must be performed with considerable prudence.

981
01:7:2,760-->01:7:4,119
No one must know.

982
01:7:4,760-->01:7:5,840
You may rely on me.

983
01:7:57,599-->01:7:59,440
Why did you bring them here?

984
01:8:0,559-->01:8:1,679
If I had not,

985
01:8:1,760-->01:8:4,960
your son would already have been strangled in his sleep without your knowledge.

986
01:8:6,680-->01:8:8,679
-Jinxi. -Yes, my lady.

987
01:8:8,760-->01:8:10,640
-Xiao Yunzi. -Yes, madam.

988
01:8:11,719-->01:8:13,520
Send the children to the bedchamber.

989
01:8:24,239-->01:8:26,280
Xia Yi incapacitated everyone with sleep-inducing incense

990
01:8:26,359-->01:8:28,560
and pricked Hongyan's toe to obtain his blood.

991
01:8:29,319-->01:8:31,600
Xia Yi works for His Majesty.

992
01:8:31,680-->01:8:34,879
His Majesty must have instructed him to prove kinship by another blood test.

993
01:8:36,199-->01:8:37,800
Yet something escapes me.

994
01:8:37,879-->01:8:40,39
Why would His Majesty need to do another blood test?

995
01:8:41,880-->01:8:44,360
Who exactly is Hongyan's father?

996
01:8:48,439-->01:8:50,439
I am truly indebted to you.

997
01:8:53,400-->01:8:55,200
You have done me a great service.

998
01:8:56,119-->01:8:57,720
You have saved Yunli's children.

999
01:9:5,120-->01:9:6,720
They are Duke Guo's children?

1000
01:9:7,560-->01:9:9,159
Are they, indeed?

1001
01:9:11,640-->01:9:13,199
The situation is dire.

1002
01:9:13,280-->01:9:16,999
He had it done to Hongyan and Lingxi. He must have grown suspicious.

1003
01:9:17,79-->01:9:18,719
You should be well prepared.

1004
01:9:20,720-->01:9:22,279
His Majesty is seriously ill.

1005
01:9:23,239-->01:9:25,840
We can no longer allow Xia Yi to live.

1006
01:9:26,800-->01:9:29,0
It is not enough simply to dispose of Xia Yi.

1007
01:9:30,279-->01:9:31,359
From here forward,

1008
01:9:32,319-->01:9:35,40
what I do is of no concern to you, it is not your business.

1009
01:9:36,640-->01:9:39,399
Care well for Duke Guo's children.

1010
01:9:51,199-->01:9:52,720
I am thirsty.

1011
01:9:54,840-->01:9:56,80
I need water.

1012
01:9:58,280-->01:9:59,600
Of course.

1013
01:9:59,680-->01:10:2,359
Your Majesty, it's time for you to take the elixir.

1014
01:10:5,520-->01:10:8,760
Allow me to help you with it.

1015
01:10:9,439-->01:10:12,600
Here, let me help you.

1016
01:10:21,359-->01:10:23,159
I remember

1017
01:10:24,79-->01:10:26,280
when you first joined the harem,

1018
01:10:27,359-->01:10:30,39
you were haughty and aloof.

1019
01:10:30,919-->01:10:31,999
But now

1020
01:10:33,119-->01:10:37,640
you have grown gentle and tender.

1021
01:10:40,800-->01:10:43,560
Your Majesty, have you ever heard the saying,

1022
01:10:44,919-->01:10:49,479
"Tenderness can kill a man just like a cut of a knife"?

1023
01:11:4,40-->01:11:5,359
I greet Your Majesty.

1024
01:11:30,520-->01:11:32,319
Where is Xia Yi?

1025
01:11:34,960-->01:11:36,560
The medicine is ready.

1026
01:11:37,239-->01:11:39,479
Your Majesty, why did you have the ginseng soup first?

1027
01:11:39,560-->01:11:41,119
Xia Yi.

1028
01:11:41,800-->01:11:44,0
Xia Yi has failed to serve Your Majesty well.

1029
01:11:44,960-->01:11:47,40
Instead, he has caused you great concern.

1030
01:11:48,119-->01:11:50,999
Your Majesty, I have already disposed of him for you.

1031
01:11:52,359-->01:11:53,679
You killed him?

1032
01:11:55,880-->01:11:58,39
You have always instructed me that

1033
01:11:58,439-->01:12:0,399
there is no need to keep useless people alive.

1034
01:12:1,439-->01:12:3,520
So you found out.

1035
01:12:4,319-->01:12:7,279
I have been living a peaceful life under your protection.

1036
01:12:7,959-->01:12:10,79
I depend entirely upon Your Majesty.

1037
01:12:10,680-->01:12:12,680
I need not trouble myself with anything more.

1038
01:12:14,600-->01:12:17,880
I have always appreciated your honesty.

1039
01:12:19,79-->01:12:21,760
I would like to ask you a question.

1040
01:12:24,159-->01:12:26,159
I will surely answer without reservation.

1041
01:12:28,680-->01:12:29,880
Hongyan...

1042
01:12:32,719-->01:12:35,520
Is he not my own son?

1043
01:12:38,400-->01:12:39,600
Of course.

1044
01:12:40,840-->01:12:45,239
Your Majesty, all the people of this nation are your children.

1045
01:12:53,520-->01:12:54,959
Well said.

1046
01:12:56,280-->01:12:57,800
Well said.

1047
01:13:0,279-->01:13:1,840
You are right.

1048
01:13:3,560-->01:13:5,760
The entire nation is mine.

1049
01:13:8,40-->01:13:10,399
Yet very soon it will be yours.

1050
01:13:12,640-->01:13:15,520
What do I need the entire nation for?

1051
01:13:17,40-->01:13:20,879
I never obtained the one thing I have desired all this time.

1052
01:13:22,520-->01:13:24,120
Throughout my life,

1053
01:13:25,800-->01:13:28,640
perhaps at one time I did obtain what I desired.

1054
01:13:31,39-->01:13:33,799
However, like sand that slips through your fingers

1055
01:13:36,159-->01:13:38,600
in the end, nothing remains.

1056
01:13:42,119-->01:13:43,560
Huan Huan.

1057
01:13:45,880-->01:13:49,840
It has been a long time since you called me "my dear".

1058
01:13:51,879-->01:13:53,720
Speak to me that way once again.

1059
01:13:55,399-->01:13:56,880
Would you?

1060
01:14:0,119-->01:14:2,279
Your Majesty, you are tired.

1061
01:14:2,359-->01:14:4,119
Rest a while.

1062
01:14:4,760-->01:14:6,40
I'd like to retire now.

1063
01:14:9,120-->01:14:11,600
Call me "my dear" once more.

1064
01:14:13,720-->01:14:17,640
Just as you did when you first entered the palace.

1065
01:14:19,279-->01:14:21,720
The Zhen Huan of those days has already died.

1066
01:14:23,560-->01:14:25,520
Have you forgotten, Your Majesty?

1067
01:14:27,39-->01:14:28,640
It was you who killed her.

1068
01:14:32,359-->01:14:37,79
I am Niohuru Zhen Huan.

1069
01:14:43,640-->01:14:45,439
We may never return to those days.

1070
01:14:46,999-->01:14:48,600
We may never return.

1071
01:14:50,359-->01:14:53,560
Huan Huan and I.

1072
01:14:54,399-->01:14:56,80
Chunyuan and I.

1073
01:14:56,720-->01:14:58,439
To those grand times

1074
01:15:1,279-->01:15:2,399
we may never return.

1075
01:15:3,960-->01:15:7,479
Because of Yunli,

1076
01:15:8,120-->01:15:11,479
you now hate me to the core, don't you?

1077
01:15:15,839-->01:15:17,240
Your Majesty, you are truly wise.

1078
01:15:19,560-->01:15:20,920
Yet please rest easy, Your Majesty.

1079
01:15:23,279-->01:15:25,720
No matter how much I hate you,

1080
01:15:26,439-->01:15:29,199
I will raise Princess Jinghe with nurturing care.

1081
01:15:31,39-->01:15:34,119
If Mei could know that the child she bore to Wen Shichu

1082
01:15:35,79-->01:15:37,560
has been doted on by Your Majesty for all these years,

1083
01:15:38,760-->01:15:42,520
I think she would be happy in the underworld.

1084
01:15:46,840-->01:15:48,880
Vile wench!

1085
01:15:50,320-->01:15:51,920
I must kill you!

1086
01:15:55,840-->01:15:58,760
Compared to Your Majesty's ruthlessness at killing your own brothers,

1087
01:15:58,839-->01:16:1,279
I am certainly no match for you.

1088
01:16:2,999-->01:16:5,40
I may as well tell you another truth, Your Majesty.

1089
01:16:5,680-->01:16:8,679
Every moment I was by your side after returning to the palace,

1090
01:16:8,760-->01:16:10,840
every moment I shared with you,

1091
01:16:11,439-->01:16:13,280
was infinitely repulsive to me.

1092
01:16:17,119-->01:16:18,960
Concubine Ning has felt the same.

1093
01:16:19,560-->01:16:20,879
Someone.

1094
01:16:22,239-->01:16:23,520
Help me.

1095
01:16:24,159-->01:16:25,880
Help me.

1096
01:16:26,959-->01:16:28,560
Help you?

1097
01:16:30,960-->01:16:33,359
The sentries at the doorways have been sent away.

1098
01:16:34,840-->01:16:36,959
Your Majesty, you have just consumed the ginseng soup.

1099
01:16:37,640-->01:16:40,120
Angering yourself is not good for your health.

1100
01:16:41,39-->01:16:45,199
It will only cause depression and intensify your inner heat.

1101
01:16:46,479-->01:16:48,479
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

1102
01:17:38,600-->01:17:40,120
My dear.

1103
01:17:43,880-->01:17:46,680
Long ago, we met in the rain surrounded by apricot blossoms.

1104
01:17:49,159-->01:17:51,479
You claimed to be Marquess Guo.

1105
01:17:55,759-->01:17:57,880
Perhaps from the very beginning,

1106
01:17:59,399-->01:18:1,479
it was all a mistake.

1107
01:18:17,479-->01:18:19,439
His Majesty

1108
01:18:25,359-->01:18:29,639
has just passed away.

1109
01:18:32,960-->01:18:36,159
IN MEMORY OF THE YONGZHENG EMPEROR

1110
01:18:36,239-->01:18:39,159
All bow.

1111
01:18:41,720-->01:18:43,0
Rise.

1112
01:18:45,279-->01:18:48,119
All bow.

1113
01:18:50,760-->01:18:52,439
Rise.

1114
01:18:54,159-->01:18:56,839
All bow a third time.

1115
01:18:58,800-->01:19:0,600
Rise.

1116
01:19:2,600-->01:19:4,279
All stand.

1117
01:19:7,720-->01:19:10,39
The ritual is completed.

1118
01:19:13,199-->01:19:15,0
A nation cannot afford one day without a sovereign.

1119
01:19:15,839-->01:19:18,40
Noble Consort Xi, please take charge of the selection.

1120
01:19:19,840-->01:19:22,600
Noble Consort Xi is the mother of two princes.

1121
01:19:23,800-->01:19:27,119
How can she take charge of the succession to the throne?

1122
01:19:27,199-->01:19:28,760
When the late Emperor was alive,

1123
01:19:28,839-->01:19:31,119
Noble Consort Xi was in charge of the Harem as Secondary Empress.

1124
01:19:31,199-->01:19:32,840
Of course she is capable.

1125
01:19:34,560-->01:19:38,800
How can a woman of the harem manage affairs of state?

1126
01:19:41,239-->01:19:45,839
When the late Emperor lived, he mentioned the succession many times.

1127
01:19:47,119-->01:19:48,880
He also did instruct me before his death.

1128
01:19:51,199-->01:19:53,40
I dare not lie.

1129
01:19:54,840-->01:19:57,560
Today, as all the dukes are assembled here,

1130
01:19:57,640-->01:19:59,839
I must tell you the truth.

1131
01:20:14,600-->01:20:17,199
The late Emperor has personally written a secret imperial edict.

1132
01:20:18,279-->01:20:20,760
The Fourth Prince, Hongli,

1133
01:20:20,840-->01:20:23,920
of noble character, having grown experienced and mature,

1134
01:20:24,0-->01:20:25,600
should ascend the throne.

1135
01:20:26,920-->01:20:30,119
How can the succession to the throne be decided by your unilateral statement?

1136
01:20:31,160-->01:20:33,719
When the Emperor was gravely ill, the Fourth Prince supervised the nation.

1137
01:20:33,799-->01:20:36,359
Duke Heng, do you intend to disrespect the late Emperor?

1138
01:20:36,439-->01:20:38,239
So this is why you doubted everything.

1139
01:20:38,319-->01:20:39,800
You...

1140
01:20:39,879-->01:20:41,720
The late Emperor showed great foresight.

1141
01:20:41,800-->01:20:45,39
He sealed the secret imperial edict with yellow paper,

1142
01:20:45,119-->01:20:47,40
kept it in a brocade box,

1143
01:20:47,119-->01:20:49,40
and hid it behind the "Justice and Honesty"

1144
01:20:49,119-->01:20:50,159
tablet that hangs in Qianqing Palace.

1145
01:20:51,239-->01:20:56,39
All lords and officials may proceed to Qianqing Palace and examine it.

1146
01:21:38,640-->01:21:43,199
THE FOUNDATION OF A POWERFUL AND PEACEFUL NATION

1147
01:22:25,79-->01:22:27,880
QIANLONG

1148
01:22:30,639-->01:22:31,760
All kneel!

1149
01:22:44,439-->01:22:46,199
You are here.

1150
01:22:47,240-->01:22:49,960
The Empress has sharp eyes and ears just as in the old days.

1151
01:22:50,40-->01:22:52,560
Today is the enthronement ceremony.

1152
01:22:52,640-->01:22:57,800
Apart from you, who else could pay me a visit at her leisure?

1153
01:23:3,560-->01:23:5,879
You haven't changed at all.

1154
01:23:6,599-->01:23:11,80
Exactly the same face I have hated all this time.

1155
01:23:13,0-->01:23:15,919
Impudence! How dare you disrespect the Empress Dowager?

1156
01:23:15,999-->01:23:17,840
Kneel now.

1157
01:23:18,840-->01:23:20,760
The new Emperor has ascended the throne!

1158
01:23:21,439-->01:23:23,840
She is the mother of the new Emperor

1159
01:23:23,920-->01:23:26,80
and has become the Holy Mother Empress Dowager.

1160
01:23:27,280-->01:23:31,160
The late Emperor never revoked my title. I am still his Empress.

1161
01:23:31,239-->01:23:33,199
Your Highness, your thoughts are muddled.

1162
01:23:33,279-->01:23:36,439
When the late Emperor lived, she was Noble Consort, in charge of the harem.

1163
01:23:36,520-->01:23:38,400
Now the Fourth Prince has ascended the throne

1164
01:23:38,479-->01:23:40,840
and acknowledged her as the one true Empress Dowager.

1165
01:23:42,880-->01:23:45,600
You did not let your own son become Emperor.

1166
01:23:46,199-->01:23:49,359
What kind of mother are you?

1167
01:23:49,439-->01:23:52,560
Being the Emperor is not the highest enjoyment on this earth.

1168
01:23:54,359-->01:23:56,920
How much did the late Emperor suffer for the intrigues of his concubines?

1169
01:23:57,0-->01:23:59,0
Not even he himself could say.

1170
01:23:59,800-->01:24:1,680
I fear greatly

1171
01:24:2,439-->01:24:7,720
lest my own son would marry an Empress such as you in the future.

1172
01:24:7,800-->01:24:10,560
How vicious you are!

1173
01:24:10,640-->01:24:15,80
How can you go against the late Emperor? How can you disregard his decree?

1174
01:24:16,479-->01:24:18,880
The late Emperor indeed promised never

1175
01:24:18,960-->01:24:21,560
to reject the Empress of the Ula Nara clan.

1176
01:24:21,640-->01:24:25,479
Therefore, you will remain Empress as long as you live.

1177
01:24:27,80-->01:24:29,160
I've decided the Emperor will be buried beside

1178
01:24:29,239-->01:24:31,640
Empress Chunyuan at Tailing Mausoleum.

1179
01:24:33,439-->01:24:36,640
After your death, you will be buried in the Tomb of the Concubines.

1180
01:24:38,479-->01:24:41,359
Please enjoy the rest of your days,

1181
01:24:42,80-->01:24:43,199
Empress.

1182
01:24:50,680-->01:24:52,640
Empress?

1183
01:24:55,959-->01:24:58,839
Empress!

1184
01:24:59,960-->01:25:2,800
I have been considering something recently.

1185
01:25:3,719-->01:25:5,879
Your Majesty, I would like to discuss it with you today.

1186
01:25:5,960-->01:25:7,120
Queen Mother, please speak.

1187
01:25:8,600-->01:25:10,600
Hongyan is my youngest son.

1188
01:25:11,200-->01:25:13,640
He was candidate for Crown Prince in the late Emperor's heart.

1189
01:25:13,720-->01:25:15,680
Now Hongyan has grown up.

1190
01:25:15,760-->01:25:18,840
If any rumors spread again and shake the foundations of the nation,

1191
01:25:18,919-->01:25:20,560
then I will be blamed.

1192
01:25:21,359-->01:25:23,560
Therefore, I ask your permission

1193
01:25:24,79-->01:25:27,280
to allow Hongyan to inherit Duke Guo's bloodline.

1194
01:25:27,359-->01:25:30,520
Queen Mother, how thoughtful of you. Of course I will allow it.

1195
01:25:31,600-->01:25:35,399
When Hongyan is grown, I will confer him as an honorable Duke,

1196
01:25:35,999-->01:25:37,879
and he will live a glorious life.

1197
01:25:37,959-->01:25:40,79
He is your own brother.

1198
01:25:41,600-->01:25:45,39
I am already aged. Of course, I must rely on you to take care of him.

1199
01:25:45,119-->01:25:48,399
You always have my interest at heart. I am overwhelmed with gratitude.

1200
01:25:49,199-->01:25:50,999
Only when I have done my utmost to care for you,

1201
01:25:51,79-->01:25:53,640
may I return the favor of your nurture and support.

1202
01:25:53,720-->01:25:56,680
Between mother and son no such words are needed.

1203
01:25:57,920-->01:26:0,919
The affairs of state are pressing. You should return to Yangxin Hall early.

1204
01:26:2,319-->01:26:5,720
In that case, I must leave. I will pay my respects to you another day.

1205
01:26:11,479-->01:26:13,319
Your Highness,

1206
01:26:13,399-->01:26:15,600
are you trying to protect the Sixth Prince?

1207
01:26:16,999-->01:26:19,40
Parents love their children immeasurably.

1208
01:26:19,119-->01:26:21,359
Of course they plan far into the future for them.

1209
01:26:21,999-->01:26:23,640
The Emperor is not my biological son.

1210
01:26:24,439-->01:26:28,199
Only if Hongyan is made heir to a branch that may never succeed to the throne,

1211
01:26:28,280-->01:26:30,399
will he be able to live a peaceful life.

1212
01:26:31,399-->01:26:35,520
For the Sixth Prince, that is a good arrangement as well.

1213
01:26:36,640-->01:26:38,239
While Duke Guo lived,

1214
01:26:39,279-->01:26:41,600
Hongyan could not call him Father.

1215
01:26:42,800-->01:26:45,720
Now that he is dead, his son will remain bound to him.

1216
01:26:50,359-->01:26:51,879
Jinxi,

1217
01:26:53,120-->01:26:54,120
I am weary.

1218
01:26:55,920-->01:26:57,159
Help me to sleep for a while.

1219
01:27:27,80-->01:27:30,199
Members of the palace come and go, live and die.

1220
01:27:30,279-->01:27:34,159
They likely number more than thousands. They have never lived in tranquility.

1221
01:27:34,799-->01:27:38,79
I have never regretted my past actions.

1222
01:27:38,159-->01:27:42,640
Even I made use of my own child's death to frame Empress Wenyu.

1223
01:27:43,520-->01:27:46,80
Because it was my only way forward.

1224
01:27:46,160-->01:27:48,520
Yet at my first misstep,

1225
01:27:48,600-->01:27:52,79
I would become a lonely ghost trampled underfoot by the others.

1226
01:27:53,679-->01:27:58,39
And I have never worried about my life coming to an end.

1227
01:27:58,720-->01:28:2,160
Since Marquess Guo and I were separated by life and death,

1228
01:28:2,240-->01:28:6,40
there is nothing in this world I am reluctant to leave behind.

1229
01:28:6,760-->01:28:10,439
There is so much I want to tell him.

1230
01:28:11,80-->01:28:16,719
I await that day with eager anticipation.
