1
00:02:34,759-->00:02:36,760
In the year of 1722,

2
00:02:36,839-->00:02:39,360
the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty passed away.

3
00:02:39,439-->00:02:41,680
Nian Gengyao, Governor-General of Chuan-Shan,

4
00:02:41,759-->00:02:43,720
and Longkodo, Commander of the Nine Gates,

5
00:02:43,799-->00:02:46,160
both played a role in the struggle over imperial succession

6
00:02:46,239-->00:02:50,520
and were key to helping the Fourth Prince, Yinzhen, ascend to the throne.

7
00:02:50,599-->00:02:53,319
Accordingly, the new Emperor held them in high esteem

8
00:02:53,400-->00:02:55,759
and granted them unequaled political power.

9
00:02:55,840-->00:02:58,80
They soon became central figures in the new government.

10
00:02:59,800-->00:03:03,600
THE YONGZHENG EMPEROR

11
00:03:09,719-->00:03:11,639
All kneel!

12
00:03:17,999-->00:03:22,599
Lotus blossoms spring up on every side. They bloom and wither, time after time,

13
00:03:22,680-->00:03:25,360
just as the concubines of the palace.

14
00:03:26,280-->00:03:29,280
"Each year and every year, the blossoms return anew.

15
00:03:29,360-->00:03:32,560
Each year and every year, the bloom of youth does not."

16
00:03:33,679-->00:03:36,319
After the Yongzheng Emperor ascended the throne,

17
00:03:36,400-->00:03:38,999
he accomplished many great feats.

18
00:03:39,80-->00:03:41,399
However, he did not have many sons.

19
00:03:41,479-->00:03:44,759
Concerned that there would not be enough male heirs to secure the throne,

20
00:03:44,839-->00:03:47,279
the Empress Dowager held auditions

21
00:03:47,360-->00:03:49,759
to fill the Imperial Harem every three years.

22
00:03:49,840-->00:03:53,520
Every girl wished to be selected,

23
00:03:53,599-->00:03:56,439
so that her whole family could rise up through her success.

24
00:03:57,599-->00:03:59,639
But I didn't hope for that.

25
00:04:00,240-->00:04:01,920
My only wish was

26
00:04:02,519-->00:04:04,720
"to capture the heart of my fated lover

27
00:04:04,800-->00:04:07,439
and cling together till our hair turns gray."

28
00:04:08,160-->00:04:11,0
However, much changes over time.

29
00:04:11,80-->00:04:15,360
No one could expect what would happen at the audition.

30
00:04:26,480-->00:04:29,679
As a pious girl, I am not allowed great achievements like men,

31
00:04:29,759-->00:04:32,400
but neither am I willing to discard my own life.

32
00:04:32,999-->00:04:34,840
If I must marry someone,

33
00:04:34,919-->00:04:38,160
only the finest of men will be my choice.

34
00:04:38,759-->00:04:42,560
I will marry him and remain by his side as long as I live.

35
00:04:43,360-->00:04:45,559
May Buddha grant me this blessing,

36
00:04:45,639-->00:04:49,40
let me be passed over for service in the Imperial Harem.

37
00:04:49,120-->00:04:51,240
ZHEN HUAN

38
00:04:53,680-->00:04:54,679
SHANGSHAN TEMPLE

39
00:04:54,759-->00:04:55,959
My lady, all other girls want to be chosen.

40
00:04:56,40-->00:04:58,40
Only you wish to be passed over.

41
00:04:58,119-->00:05:00,39
LIUZHU – HUANBI

42
00:05:00,720-->00:05:03,919
The Buddha will surely remember your prayers.

43
00:05:03,999-->00:05:06,240
Don't say it aloud or it will not come true.

44
00:05:06,319-->00:05:09,40
WEN SHICHU

45
00:05:10,120-->00:05:13,759
Is today a festival day? Even Doctor Wen has come to the temple.

46
00:05:17,360-->00:05:19,160
- Shichu. - Huan.

47
00:05:19,959-->00:05:21,439
I just checked up on your family.

48
00:05:21,519-->00:05:24,120
Your mother told me you'd come here to offer incense.

49
00:05:24,199-->00:05:26,80
Simply for a stroll and to pass an idle hour.

50
00:05:27,119-->00:05:29,880
Huan, don't try to hide it from me.

51
00:05:30,440-->00:05:34,399
I know you've been worried about the audition for many days.

52
00:05:35,920-->00:05:39,360
I may only do what I'm allowed. The rest I leave to fate.

53
00:05:40,319-->00:05:43,119
Huan, when my father lived, he often said,

54
00:05:43,199-->00:05:44,759
"A jade vessel is the symbol of a pure heart."

55
00:05:45,559-->00:05:48,839
He wanted me to give this to my future–

56
00:05:49,519-->00:05:51,600
It is my own wish as well.

57
00:05:51,680-->00:05:55,40
If you accept this, you won't be called to the audition.

58
00:05:56,879-->00:05:59,880
In the time of the Shunzhi Emperor, it was decreed

59
00:05:59,960-->00:06:03,399
that girls qualified to join the harem may not marry before the audition.

60
00:06:04,40-->00:06:08,439
Though you intend to help, you need not give me such a valuable item.

61
00:06:09,40-->00:06:10,679
I'm profoundly flattered.

62
00:06:11,279-->00:06:14,920
Huan, I'm merely an imperial doctor with the means of a humble official,

63
00:06:15,0-->00:06:17,519
but I promise to cherish you for as long as I live,

64
00:06:17,600-->00:06:20,959
to love you, protect you and place you above all else.

65
00:06:21,519-->00:06:23,560
Although you may find my words imprudent,

66
00:06:23,640-->00:06:26,639
I truly hope you are passed over at the audition.

67
00:06:26,720-->00:06:28,959
My father was once implicated due to strife in the harem.

68
00:06:29,360-->00:06:31,40
He was unable to preserve his good name.

69
00:06:31,119-->00:06:32,720
If this can befall even an imperial doctor,

70
00:06:32,800-->00:06:36,240
then a concubine will not be spared.

71
00:06:36,799-->00:06:38,480
I understand your concern.

72
00:06:39,160-->00:06:42,839
But if I don't take part now, my sister Yurao must do so eventually.

73
00:06:42,920-->00:06:44,519
My parents have no sons.

74
00:06:44,600-->00:06:46,680
I have no choice but to perform my filial duty.

75
00:07:12,520-->00:07:14,360
- Mei. - Huan.

76
00:07:14,440-->00:07:15,800
SHEN MEIZHUANG

77
00:07:15,880-->00:07:19,279
I heard you were summoned but hadn't had a chance to greet you.

78
00:07:19,359-->00:07:20,999
I had hoped for the opposite.

79
00:07:22,640-->00:07:24,679
Now you have a residence here in the capital

80
00:07:24,759-->00:07:26,399
and no longer live with your grandparents.

81
00:07:26,480-->00:07:29,240
- Now we may visit one another often. - Absolutely.

82
00:07:29,319-->00:07:33,160
I often remember with fondness the bond we shared growing up together.

83
00:07:34,680-->00:07:36,920
You dressed quite plainly today.

84
00:07:36,999-->00:07:40,600
Even so, the observant will notice your true beauty.

85
00:07:40,679-->00:07:42,360
It cannot be hidden.

86
00:07:49,359-->00:07:50,720
THE EMPRESS DOWAGER

87
00:07:50,799-->00:07:53,920
Xia Ruhua, daughter of the Magistrate of Jiaxing County, is passed over.

88
00:07:54,0-->00:07:56,40
Bestow the flower.

89
00:08:00,280-->00:08:01,799
What family are you from?

90
00:08:01,879-->00:08:04,319
How can you pour hot tea on me? You must be punished!

91
00:08:04,399-->00:08:07,39
- I'm sorry. - Answer me! Who is your father?

92
00:08:07,119-->00:08:08,560
AN LINGRONG

93
00:08:08,640-->00:08:12,879
My name is An Lingrong. My father–

94
00:08:14,760-->00:08:17,679
My father is An Bihuai, Deputy Magistrate of Songyang County.

95
00:08:19,359-->00:08:22,279
I knew you were from a humble family of the provinces.

96
00:08:22,360-->00:08:25,799
I, Lingrong, am at fault. Please forgive me.

97
00:08:25,879-->00:08:27,279
XIA DONGCHUN

98
00:08:27,359-->00:08:29,39
I may forgive you,

99
00:08:29,760-->00:08:32,80
but you must first bow down and beg for my forgiveness.

100
00:08:32,159-->00:08:34,440
Only then will I show clemency, this once.

101
00:08:42,119-->00:08:43,559
On your knees.

102
00:08:46,639-->00:08:48,519
It's only a dress.

103
00:08:48,600-->00:08:51,559
I know you are kind and generous. You mustn't be angered by trifles.

104
00:08:52,160-->00:08:53,799
Who are you?

105
00:08:53,879-->00:08:57,119
My father is Zhen Yuandao, Deputy Chief of the Grand Court of Review.

106
00:08:57,200-->00:09:01,600
Deputy Chief of the Grand Court is not a high-ranking office.

107
00:09:02,200-->00:09:05,919
Rank is of no importance. Justice is all that matters.

108
00:09:05,999-->00:09:08,120
They now audition the Han Army of the Eight Banners.

109
00:09:08,200-->00:09:09,999
Your behavior may disturb His Majesty.

110
00:09:10,640-->00:09:13,960
If His Majesty vents his wrath, there is no way for us to make amends.

111
00:09:14,39-->00:09:16,400
It will also tarnish the reputation of the Han Banners.

112
00:09:16,479-->00:09:19,440
Such behavior does more harm than good. I hope you think twice.

113
00:09:25,719-->00:09:28,79
- Are you all right? - Thank you for intervening.

114
00:09:28,960-->00:09:31,799
I will never forget your kindness as long as I live.

115
00:09:31,879-->00:09:34,320
Think nothing of it.

116
00:09:35,240-->00:09:39,80
How do you dare act so brashly even within the Imperial Palace?

117
00:09:39,160-->00:09:41,360
- And you are– - This is Meizhuang.

118
00:09:41,880-->00:09:43,639
Please accept my greetings, Meizhuang.

119
00:09:43,720-->00:09:45,599
No need to be so courteous.

120
00:09:53,840-->00:09:55,559
"The clothing completes the person."

121
00:09:55,640-->00:09:58,320
It's true everywhere in the world without exception.

122
00:09:58,799-->00:10:02,399
You dressed simply but elegantly. No wonder they looked down on you.

123
00:10:04,440-->00:10:07,440
I give you these earrings as a gift to commemorate our first meeting.

124
00:10:07,520-->00:10:09,279
No, no.

125
00:10:09,360-->00:10:12,799
May your wishes come true and may you enjoy the fruits of success.

126
00:10:13,840-->00:10:15,519
I thank you for your generosity,

127
00:10:16,119-->00:10:17,799
but I was born into a humble family.

128
00:10:18,679-->00:10:20,639
I may not be able to repay your kindness.

129
00:10:21,480-->00:10:23,320
"Birth is much but breeding is more."

130
00:10:23,399-->00:10:26,120
You're a beauty. Do not begrudge yourself that.

131
00:10:28,360-->00:10:32,39
An Lingrong, daughter of An Bihuai, Deputy Magistrate of Songyang County.

132
00:10:32,120-->00:10:34,80
Age, sixteen.

133
00:10:34,879-->00:10:37,479
An Lingrong bows in respect before His Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

134
00:10:37,559-->00:10:39,799
May blessings and peace be with you.

135
00:10:43,880-->00:10:46,760
You are passed over. Bestow the flower.

136
00:10:47,640-->00:10:50,80
I'm grateful to Your Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

137
00:10:50,160-->00:10:53,640
May Your Majesty and Your Highness enjoy health and happiness forever.

138
00:10:54,960-->00:10:58,159
Others showed displeasure when they were passed over,

139
00:10:58,239-->00:11:00,440
but your response was filled with courtesy.

140
00:11:00,519-->00:11:03,360
Being allowed to meet Your Majesty and Your Highness

141
00:11:03,440-->00:11:05,639
is the highest honor indeed.

142
00:11:11,639-->00:11:14,39
The begonia in your hair is quite elegant.

143
00:11:16,479-->00:11:21,359
Queen Mother, no need to bestow a flower, since she already wears one in her hair.

144
00:11:22,919-->00:11:27,919
An Lingrong is selected. Bestow the sachet.

145
00:11:35,600-->00:11:37,200
That one.

146
00:11:41,39-->00:11:44,840
Xia Dongchun, daughter of Xia Wei, Captain of the Imperial Guard.

147
00:11:44,920-->00:11:46,119
Age, eighteen.

148
00:11:46,200-->00:11:49,200
Her name is intriguing. She is selected.

149
00:11:53,279-->00:11:55,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

150
00:12:00,239-->00:12:03,879
Shen Meizhuang, daughter of Shen Zishan, Colonel of Jizhou Garrison.

151
00:12:04,480-->00:12:06,320
Age, seventeen.

152
00:12:06,919-->00:12:10,719
Shen Meizhuang bows in respect before His Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

153
00:12:10,799-->00:12:13,159
May Your Majesty enjoy long life and blessings.

154
00:12:13,239-->00:12:16,0
May Your Highness enjoy good health and peace.

155
00:12:16,679-->00:12:18,519
Have you read any books?

156
00:12:18,600-->00:12:23,919
I am slow and can barely read, only Rules for Women and Advice for Women.

157
00:12:24,679-->00:12:27,600
Most girls have only mastered the arts of sewing and embroidery.

158
00:12:28,399-->00:12:30,799
It is truly impressive that you are able to read.

159
00:12:31,600-->00:12:33,919
I thank Your Majesty and Your Highness.

160
00:12:34,919-->00:12:37,119
Write down her name.

161
00:12:37,999-->00:12:42,639
Shen Meizhuang is selected. Bestow the sachet.

162
00:12:44,480-->00:12:48,200
Zhen Huan, daughter of Zhen Yuandao, Deputy Chief of the Grand Court of Review.

163
00:12:48,279-->00:12:50,0
Age, seventeen.

164
00:12:54,559-->00:12:58,279
Zhen Huan, daughter of Zhen Yuandao, Deputy Chief of the Grand Court of Review.

165
00:12:58,360-->00:13:00,480
Age, seventeen.

166
00:13:01,760-->00:13:04,599
Zhen Huan bows in respect before His Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

167
00:13:04,679-->00:13:07,240
May blessings and peace be with you.

168
00:13:07,320-->00:13:10,640
Zhen Huan, with which character do you write the name "Huan"?

169
00:13:11,480-->00:13:15,159
"Huan huan" once described the slim waist of the concubines of the Chu palace.

170
00:13:15,239-->00:13:17,320
It's from a poem by Cai Shen.

171
00:13:18,119-->00:13:19,399
Yes, sir.

172
00:13:19,480-->00:13:24,119
You are versed in poetry and literature. Zhen Yuandao raised his daughter well.

173
00:13:24,200-->00:13:27,119
I only wonder if you're a match for such an auspicious name.

174
00:13:27,200-->00:13:29,80
Lift your head.

175
00:13:45,239-->00:13:46,440
Come forward.

176
00:14:12,919-->00:14:14,519
Fairly decent.

177
00:14:15,120-->00:14:18,879
"Beauties of slim waist in the Chu palace are quite graceful and charming.

178
00:14:18,960-->00:14:22,200
But their youth and beauty will fade away with the years."

179
00:14:23,80-->00:14:25,919
The Forbidden City is a nourishing place.

180
00:14:26,0-->00:14:28,399
Your youth and beauty will never fade.

181
00:14:34,239-->00:14:36,39
Those who would stay must leave,

182
00:14:36,120-->00:14:38,719
and those who would leave must stay forever.

183
00:14:39,320-->00:14:43,799
Many girls dream of being selected for the harem. Do not be sad.

184
00:14:43,880-->00:14:47,720
Besides, we've both been selected. We can take care of each other.

185
00:14:47,799-->00:14:51,200
Mei, it was truly not my wish to be selected.

186
00:14:51,280-->00:14:54,600
Yes, but it is heaven's wish.

187
00:14:54,679-->00:14:57,760
You will not be granted an ordinary life when you can live an extraordinary one.

188
00:14:58,399-->00:15:00,480
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

189
00:15:00,559-->00:15:02,399
Several fine beauties will be added to the harem.

190
00:15:02,480-->00:15:06,320
Among the ordinary ones, it's pleasing that one or two are acceptable.

191
00:15:06,399-->00:15:07,600
More than acceptable.

192
00:15:07,679-->00:15:10,400
I've heard Shen Zishan's daughter quite resembles the young Concubine Jing.

193
00:15:10,480-->00:15:11,480
THE EMPRESS

194
00:15:11,559-->00:15:13,320
And Zhen is practically identical to–

195
00:15:17,599-->00:15:20,119
She's somewhat similar around the eyes.

196
00:15:20,200-->00:15:23,519
Somewhat similar is already quite enough.

197
00:15:24,200-->00:15:26,120
Please forgive my curiosity.

198
00:15:26,200-->00:15:29,279
But which rank will you grant to Zhen?

199
00:15:30,0-->00:15:32,799
Sixth rank, First Attendant. We will call her "Wan."

200
00:15:32,959-->00:15:33,999
CONSORT HUA

201
00:15:34,80-->00:15:35,119
First Attendant Wan?

202
00:15:35,200-->00:15:38,359
Yes, my lady. Daughter of Zhen Yuandao, Deputy Chief of the Grand Court.

203
00:15:38,440-->00:15:40,80
Among the newly selected concubines,

204
00:15:40,159-->00:15:43,599
she was the only one given an honorific name, but her rank is not high.

205
00:15:43,679-->00:15:46,159
The one who made a display of her eloquence at the audition?

206
00:15:46,240-->00:15:47,559
Yes, my lady. Exactly.

207
00:15:48,760-->00:15:52,320
Was it His Majesty's decision to allot Chengqian Palace to her?

208
00:15:52,399-->00:15:56,520
His Majesty wasn't involved. It was decided by the Empress.

209
00:15:56,600-->00:15:59,200
Chengqian Palace is a wondrous place.

210
00:15:59,279-->00:16:03,39
Not only spacious and magnificent, but also near His Majesty's Yangxin Hall.

211
00:16:03,119-->00:16:06,160
The Empress always knows how to please His Majesty.

212
00:16:06,239-->00:16:08,999
She will do anything to curry favor with His Majesty.

213
00:16:09,80-->00:16:10,559
ZHOU NINGHAI – SONGZHI

214
00:16:10,640-->00:16:12,320
Is there another palace available?

215
00:16:12,400-->00:16:16,240
Yes, there is. Suiyu Pavilion, where Lady Fang used to reside.

216
00:16:16,840-->00:16:18,919
It is clean and exquisite,

217
00:16:18,999-->00:16:22,160
but it's a bit remote, a bit distant, and a bit small.

218
00:16:22,240-->00:16:25,79
Besides, it's considered unpropitious.

219
00:16:25,160-->00:16:26,760
Unpropitious?

220
00:16:27,600-->00:16:30,360
Just because Lady Fang was sent to the Cold Palace after miscarriage?

221
00:16:30,839-->00:16:33,759
I see no reason for such taboos.

222
00:16:35,80-->00:16:36,520
Your Highness,

223
00:16:36,599-->00:16:40,39
Consort Hua has changed the residence of Attendant Wan to Suiyu Pavilion.

224
00:16:43,39-->00:16:44,840
I pity her.

225
00:16:47,39-->00:16:50,480
Consort Hua is domineering. She decided without even asking your view.

226
00:16:50,559-->00:16:51,559
JIANQIU

227
00:16:52,279-->00:16:55,520
It's not the first time you've met Consort Hua. She has always acted so.

228
00:16:55,599-->00:16:57,679
But His Majesty loves her exactly as she is.

229
00:17:00,159-->00:17:02,120
Another strand of gray hair.

230
00:17:05,280-->00:17:07,479
I bow to Your Majesty. May good fortune be with you.

231
00:17:08,880-->00:17:11,599
Where is Consort Hua? Why didn't she come to greet me?

232
00:17:11,679-->00:17:14,480
Your Majesty, my lady was indisposed today.

233
00:17:14,559-->00:17:16,359
She went to bed early.

234
00:17:17,119-->00:17:20,880
In that case, I'll leave.

235
00:17:21,959-->00:17:25,160
I must meet with Consort Qi and the Third Prince.

236
00:17:25,239-->00:17:28,400
Leave now, and you'll never again pass through the gates of Yikun Palace.

237
00:17:30,920-->00:17:34,279
Hypocrite. You grow even more capricious.

238
00:17:34,359-->00:17:36,439
Your Majesty hasn't called on me for a while.

239
00:17:36,520-->00:17:38,799
I assumed you had forgotten me.

240
00:17:39,880-->00:17:41,679
You're the only one

241
00:17:41,760-->00:17:45,679
who dares behave so recklessly in my presence.

242
00:17:46,960-->00:17:49,79
So fragrant.

243
00:17:49,160-->00:17:53,319
Your Majesty grants Huanyi Incense to me exclusively and I use it every day.

244
00:17:53,400-->00:17:56,79
Yes, I truly love the fragrance.

245
00:17:56,880-->00:17:59,0
The others don't have it.

246
00:18:14,279-->00:18:16,719
FANGRUO

247
00:18:31,39-->00:18:34,279
Bow to the young mistresses. May good fortune be with you.

248
00:18:37,999-->00:18:41,40
- This is– - The side door to Shunzhen Gate.

249
00:18:41,679-->00:18:44,320
Concubines must enter the palace by going through the side door.

250
00:18:44,400-->00:18:47,599
Only the Empress is allowed to enter through the main gate.

251
00:18:48,520-->00:18:49,599
Mei.

252
00:18:54,80-->00:18:57,199
Young mistress, now is not the time to converse.

253
00:18:57,279-->00:18:59,480
The eunuchs will lead you to your residences.

254
00:18:59,559-->00:19:01,240
It's getting late.

255
00:19:01,319-->00:19:04,640
The Imperial Household Department has delivered your belongings to your palaces.

256
00:19:04,720-->00:19:06,359
Young mistresses, please enter the palace.

257
00:19:14,279-->00:19:16,359
It seems so deserted.

258
00:19:17,160-->00:19:19,279
It's not deserted. It's peaceful and quiet.

259
00:19:19,359-->00:19:23,240
Good, our young mistress loves peace and quiet.

260
00:19:40,160-->00:19:44,239
Kang Luhai, lead eunuch of Suiyu Pavilion, bows in respect before Attendant Wan.

261
00:19:44,320-->00:19:45,319
KANG LUHAI

262
00:19:46,760-->00:19:48,680
May you enjoy happiness and good fortune.

263
00:19:51,119-->00:19:54,160
Cui Jinxi, lead maid of Suiyu Pavilion, bows in respect before Attendant Wan.

264
00:19:54,239-->00:19:55,239
CUI JINXI

265
00:19:55,320-->00:19:56,799
May good fortune be with you.

266
00:19:57,760-->00:19:59,0
Please rise.

267
00:19:59,79-->00:20:01,160
- Yes, mistress. - Thank you, First Attendant.

268
00:20:02,920-->00:20:06,119
From now on, you are all my servants.

269
00:20:07,440-->00:20:10,359
I expect each of you to do your part.

270
00:20:11,240-->00:20:13,640
Loyalty should always come first.

271
00:20:13,719-->00:20:14,880
Yes, mistress.

272
00:20:14,959-->00:20:16,240
Will you remember that?

273
00:20:16,319-->00:20:20,559
We promise to be loyal to you without a second thought.

274
00:20:21,880-->00:20:23,440
Rewards.

275
00:20:28,280-->00:20:29,799
We are at your service.

276
00:20:29,880-->00:20:32,959
Young mistress, you must be tired. Please rest.

277
00:20:35,919-->00:20:37,520
YANXI PALACE

278
00:20:48,200-->00:20:50,919
I'm flattered. The Empress sent you to bring the gifts personally.

279
00:20:51,0-->00:20:52,279
It's an honor.

280
00:20:52,359-->00:20:54,600
Think nothing of it. Now I must excuse myself.

281
00:20:54,680-->00:20:56,559
Farewell then.

282
00:20:56,640-->00:20:58,280
I'll see myself out.

283
00:21:06,200-->00:21:09,839
You come from a humble family. No wonder others treat you poorly.

284
00:21:12,440-->00:21:15,720
Such meager gifts. You have my sympathies.

285
00:21:22,39-->00:21:25,839
Gifts from Consort Hua can't compare to those from the Empress.

286
00:21:25,920-->00:21:28,559
Make a dress from the fabric the Empress gave us right away.

287
00:21:29,720-->00:21:32,280
I'll wear it to the first official audience

288
00:21:32,359-->00:21:34,359
with the Empress to show my gratitude.

289
00:21:35,319-->00:21:36,319
Yes, mistress.

290
00:21:39,280-->00:21:40,480
BAOJUAN

291
00:21:40,559-->00:21:42,79
She always acts like this. Who can bear it?

292
00:21:44,200-->00:21:45,799
SUIYU PAVILION

293
00:21:45,880-->00:21:48,160
I now live in Xianfu Palace.

294
00:21:48,239-->00:21:51,439
The palace mistress is Concubine Jing. She is kind and accommodating.

295
00:21:52,39-->00:21:54,80
And for you?

296
00:21:55,279-->00:21:56,640
As for me,

297
00:21:57,359-->00:22:00,960
Lady Fucha doesn't seem overbearing.

298
00:22:01,559-->00:22:03,400
But First Attendant Xia–

299
00:22:04,880-->00:22:06,359
I'll just ignore her.

300
00:22:06,959-->00:22:08,599
I'll only talk with you two.

301
00:22:08,680-->00:22:12,480
By the way, you didn't bring any private servants with you.

302
00:22:12,560-->00:22:14,880
Have the imperial maids served you well?

303
00:22:16,640-->00:22:19,599
Baojuan is smart, she's a reliable one.

304
00:22:19,679-->00:22:22,359
The other two young maids are only fifteen.

305
00:22:22,440-->00:22:24,559
I don't expect much from them.

306
00:22:24,640-->00:22:29,39
But it's fine, I'm used to a simple life. It doesn't matter at all.

307
00:22:30,40-->00:22:31,519
Jinxi.

308
00:22:33,320-->00:22:34,799
Yes, mistress.

309
00:22:34,880-->00:22:36,239
Go tell the Empress

310
00:22:36,319-->00:22:39,119
that I'm sending Juqing to Yanxi Palace to serve Attendant An instead.

311
00:22:40,279-->00:22:41,319
Yes, mistress.

312
00:22:42,480-->00:22:45,79
Juqing may be young, but she is loyal and reliable.

313
00:22:45,159-->00:22:47,79
You may take her with you when you return.

314
00:22:47,160-->00:22:50,399
If you need anything else, just feel free to ask me or Mei.

315
00:22:50,480-->00:22:51,839
Thank you.

316
00:22:51,920-->00:22:55,160
I just received some satin today, and I think it'll suit you well.

317
00:22:55,239-->00:22:58,519
I'll ask Caiyue to take it to Yanxi Palace.

318
00:22:59,119-->00:23:03,239
You two treat me so kindly. It's more than I can return.

319
00:23:06,680-->00:23:11,520
What you have done for me is greatly appreciated.

320
00:23:12,680-->00:23:14,640
The three of us entered the palace together,

321
00:23:14,720-->00:23:16,680
and we know each other very well.

322
00:23:16,760-->00:23:19,359
Of course we should take care of each other.

323
00:23:24,280-->00:23:25,480
JIANG FUHAI

324
00:23:25,559-->00:23:29,359
All young mistresses must perform the formal salutation to the Empress.

325
00:23:38,240-->00:23:41,319
Your Highness the Empress, may blessings and peace be with you.

326
00:23:41,400-->00:23:42,480
You may rise.

327
00:23:43,79-->00:23:45,359
Thank you, Your Highness.

328
00:23:45,440-->00:23:47,839
Please also greet the other concubines.

329
00:23:48,440-->00:23:52,119
All young mistresses must bow in respect before Consort Hua.

330
00:23:55,119-->00:23:58,319
May blessings and peace be with you, my lady.

331
00:24:00,560-->00:24:02,39
You may rise.

332
00:24:02,119-->00:24:04,560
Thank you, my lady.

333
00:24:05,319-->00:24:07,999
I hear that Attendant Xia is quite clever.

334
00:24:09,319-->00:24:12,359
May blessings and peace be with you, my lady.

335
00:24:12,440-->00:24:15,200
I'm a First Attendant from the Xia family.

336
00:24:16,39-->00:24:17,800
Attendant Xia dresses very well.

337
00:24:18,440-->00:24:21,280
Your dress is made from expensive material, isn't it?

338
00:24:22,799-->00:24:26,920
It was a gift from Her Highness the Empress.

339
00:24:26,999-->00:24:29,680
I specifically chose this dress for today's audience.

340
00:24:30,960-->00:24:34,640
I see that you know how to show gratitude, you are kindhearted.

341
00:24:35,240-->00:24:36,239
Rise.

342
00:24:36,319-->00:24:37,520
Thank you, my lady.

343
00:24:38,960-->00:24:42,119
Which ones are Lady Shen and Attendant Wan?

344
00:24:42,199-->00:24:46,640
I am Lady Shen of Xianfu Palace. I bow in respect before Consort Hua.

345
00:24:46,719-->00:24:50,760
I'm Zhen Huan of Suiyu Pavilion. I bow in respect before Consort Hua.

346
00:24:50,839-->00:24:52,640
Lady Shen is quite elegant and graceful.

347
00:24:54,39-->00:24:57,359
Attendant Wan has dressed a little plainly,

348
00:24:57,440-->00:24:59,599
but her beauty cannot be concealed.

349
00:25:00,200-->00:25:02,559
His Majesty has a keen eye for spotting a true beauty.

350
00:25:02,640-->00:25:04,920
Each of these is outstanding.

351
00:25:04,999-->00:25:06,640
All right, rise.

352
00:25:06,720-->00:25:08,999
Thank you, Consort Hua.

353
00:25:10,959-->00:25:14,320
My lady, you are the true beauty of the nation, drawing all attention.

354
00:25:14,400-->00:25:18,39
Your radiance is superior to ours. We dare not compete with the Consort.

355
00:25:19,79-->00:25:21,439
Your words are sweet indeed.

356
00:25:22,319-->00:25:25,119
But the phrase "beauty of the nation,"

357
00:25:26,479-->00:25:29,160
isn't that reserved for the Empress?

358
00:25:29,840-->00:25:32,880
Her Highness the Empress glows as bright as the moon.

359
00:25:32,959-->00:25:35,800
Consort Hua's beauty sparkles like a shining pearl.

360
00:25:35,880-->00:25:38,79
We are not capable of being compared with you.

361
00:25:40,839-->00:25:44,640
I see there are more and more clever tongues in the Imperial Harem.

362
00:25:49,519-->00:25:52,920
You two really do have clever tongues.

363
00:25:52,999-->00:25:55,640
After pleasing the Empress, you start flattering Consort Hua.

364
00:25:55,720-->00:25:58,280
You put on a show before everyone to curry favor with both sides.

365
00:25:58,359-->00:25:59,959
Truly admirable.

366
00:26:02,319-->00:26:04,440
I bow in respect before Attendant Xia.

367
00:26:08,119-->00:26:12,240
You've both asked your servants to carry so many gifts.

368
00:26:12,319-->00:26:14,279
Do you have enough room to keep them?

369
00:26:14,920-->00:26:18,920
We intend to share all the imperial favors we've received.

370
00:26:18,999-->00:26:23,319
I planned to send some to your residences after returning to my palace.

371
00:26:23,400-->00:26:25,200
But since we've met here,

372
00:26:25,279-->00:26:28,359
please pick out whatever you like.

373
00:26:28,960-->00:26:31,280
Attendant Xia, please choose first.

374
00:26:31,880-->00:26:35,119
My family's residence is already filled with such decorations.

375
00:26:35,719-->00:26:39,319
But surely Lady Shen will bestow some small charity on you.

376
00:26:39,400-->00:26:42,199
It seems she's quite good at catering to others.

377
00:26:43,559-->00:26:47,800
How was someone like her selected? There's not a bit of good in her.

378
00:26:47,880-->00:26:51,599
The Xia family is not even on a par with the servants of the Nian family.

379
00:26:52,839-->00:26:54,440
Look at her dress.

380
00:26:55,599-->00:27:00,119
She thinks she can swagger around because of the Empress' support.

381
00:27:00,200-->00:27:03,599
On the day of the audition, I accidentally offended you.

382
00:27:03,680-->00:27:07,440
I haven't stopped thinking about my mistake, and I am sorry for it.

383
00:27:08,40-->00:27:10,720
Since you're from a military family,

384
00:27:10,799-->00:27:13,960
you are surely endowed with civil and martial virtues.

385
00:27:14,39-->00:27:16,280
As I expected, you're truly resolute and brave.

386
00:27:16,359-->00:27:18,200
You will surely bring honor to your family's name.

387
00:27:18,279-->00:27:20,519
That's exactly how I was brought up.

388
00:27:21,880-->00:27:24,519
Such stupidity actually exists in the world.

389
00:27:24,600-->00:27:27,480
But she was granted the rank of First Attendant.

390
00:27:29,160-->00:27:30,560
Yes, my lady.

391
00:27:40,119-->00:27:43,319
You're a concubine, just like her. You cannot hit her.

392
00:27:49,999-->00:27:51,599
Let go of me!

393
00:27:55,0-->00:27:57,519
May blessings and peace be with you, Consort Hua.

394
00:27:58,680-->00:28:00,200
Consort Hua.

395
00:28:00,279-->00:28:02,319
Zhou Ninghai, let her go.

396
00:28:04,200-->00:28:06,799
In early fall, the Imperial Garden is as beautiful as a picture,

397
00:28:06,880-->00:28:09,960
but the magnificent prospect is tainted by someone.

398
00:28:10,39-->00:28:12,240
What a disappointment.

399
00:28:12,319-->00:28:14,599
Second Attendant An tried to insult me.

400
00:28:14,680-->00:28:17,239
I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

401
00:28:17,920-->00:28:19,599
That's all.

402
00:28:20,480-->00:28:23,319
Are the Empress and I no longer present?

403
00:28:23,400-->00:28:26,599
I didn't know that Attendant Xia had been put in charge of the harem,

404
00:28:27,400-->00:28:29,359
taking on the duty of instructing the others.

405
00:28:30,799-->00:28:34,880
I'm afraid you're not qualified to take up this responsibility.

406
00:28:37,359-->00:28:40,359
The red hue of the maple isn't very striking this year.

407
00:28:42,199-->00:28:46,519
They say the maple turns brilliant red if dyed with a little blood.

408
00:28:46,599-->00:28:47,599
Is that true?

409
00:28:48,400-->00:28:51,160
Then I will award Attendant Xia the Scarlet Red

410
00:28:51,239-->00:28:55,239
so that we may add some red color to the maples with her blood.

411
00:28:55,320-->00:28:56,640
The Scarlet Red?

412
00:28:57,240-->00:29:00,640
Young mistress, the Scarlet Red is a kind of punishment in the harem.

413
00:29:00,720-->00:29:04,720
A beating with a wooden board that is two cun thick and six chi long,

414
00:29:04,799-->00:29:08,40
until bone and tendon are broken, and the flesh is badly lacerated.

415
00:29:08,119-->00:29:12,79
From a distance, you will see a patch of vibrant red, a most beautiful color.

416
00:29:12,160-->00:29:14,0
For that reason, it is called the Scarlet Red.

417
00:29:14,799-->00:29:17,319
Young mistress, please come with me.

418
00:29:19,160-->00:29:22,599
Consort Hua, spare me!

419
00:29:22,680-->00:29:24,519
Spare me!

420
00:29:24,600-->00:29:27,599
Now, take her to the Office of Punishment.

421
00:29:27,680-->00:29:29,279
Consort Hua, spare me!

422
00:29:29,359-->00:29:31,559
Consort Hua!

423
00:29:32,39-->00:29:34,160
Consort Hua, spare me!

424
00:29:34,240-->00:29:37,520
Xia disrespected her superiors and acted in a reckless manner.

425
00:29:37,599-->00:29:39,600
You may very well be startled.

426
00:29:40,400-->00:29:43,680
However, though you may not have violated any rules,

427
00:29:44,200-->00:29:47,400
it was you three who stirred up this whole incident.

428
00:29:48,119-->00:29:51,319
Shut yourselves away and reflect on your mistakes.

429
00:30:01,480-->00:30:04,200
I was scared to death.

430
00:30:04,279-->00:30:07,680
Xia was stupid and arrogant, but her punishment was excessive.

431
00:30:07,759-->00:30:10,400
I knew that Consort Hua was formidable, but never imagined to this extent.

432
00:30:11,839-->00:30:15,0
Consort Hua ordered us to reflect on our mistakes.

433
00:30:15,79-->00:30:17,599
Just to reflect on our mistakes. No need to be afraid.

434
00:30:19,119-->00:30:20,160
What's the matter?

435
00:30:23,839-->00:30:25,480
What happened?

436
00:30:25,559-->00:30:27,160
Young mistress, I was on my shift.

437
00:30:27,240-->00:30:30,679
I went to check the water level in each well of the Imperial Garden.

438
00:30:30,760-->00:30:34,160
As soon as I arrived, I saw that the well–

439
00:30:34,240-->00:30:36,119
I will go see for myself.

440
00:30:45,519-->00:30:46,960
Fuzi?

441
00:30:47,39-->00:30:49,679
How did a maid fall into a well?

442
00:30:49,760-->00:30:51,119
I don't know.

443
00:30:51,200-->00:30:54,199
The place is quite remote, people seldom pass by.

444
00:30:54,280-->00:30:55,640
Of course you wouldn't know.

445
00:30:55,720-->00:30:58,359
It was I who appointed Fuzi to serve Consort Hua.

446
00:30:59,559-->00:31:01,119
Rise.

447
00:31:02,319-->00:31:04,999
I have one more item to report.

448
00:31:05,80-->00:31:06,239
Speak.

449
00:31:06,319-->00:31:10,400
Consort Hua has punished Attendant Xia with the Scarlet Red.

450
00:31:12,319-->00:31:15,240
Xia was irritating. She deserved it.

451
00:31:15,839-->00:31:19,200
I'm terribly sorry for Fuzi. She died for nothing.

452
00:31:19,279-->00:31:21,839
She was a mere serving girl.

453
00:31:21,920-->00:31:24,160
What connections does Fuzi have?

454
00:31:24,239-->00:31:25,920
Am I not allowed to scold her?

455
00:31:26,520-->00:31:29,400
She is just a humble servant. She doesn't have any connections.

456
00:31:30,519-->00:31:31,839
I see.

457
00:31:31,920-->00:31:36,160
The other day, she hurt me in clumsiness while combing my hair.

458
00:31:36,239-->00:31:37,999
I scolded her for it.

459
00:31:38,79-->00:31:41,479
She cried out and ran away. She hasn't come back ever since.

460
00:31:41,559-->00:31:47,239
I thought that was how the Empress disciplined her servants.

461
00:31:48,320-->00:31:51,239
My lady, Fuzi is dead.

462
00:31:52,999-->00:31:54,39
Dead?

463
00:31:57,79-->00:31:58,519
How did she die?

464
00:31:59,239-->00:32:00,679
When did it happen?

465
00:32:00,760-->00:32:04,79
Her body was just pulled from the well. It was badly swollen.

466
00:32:04,879-->00:32:08,279
It was surely the day you scolded her. She cried and ran off afterwards.

467
00:32:08,359-->00:32:12,0
She was careless and fell in the well. Right, Jiang Fuhai?

468
00:32:12,640-->00:32:15,839
My lady, I dare not speak.

469
00:32:15,920-->00:32:17,480
Why not?

470
00:32:18,79-->00:32:19,479
Eunuch,

471
00:32:19,560-->00:32:22,919
are you implying that someone pushed her from behind?

472
00:32:23,480-->00:32:25,640
- I wouldn't dare. - No matter!

473
00:32:26,439-->00:32:30,360
If you won't take my word, you may investigate all my servants.

474
00:32:30,440-->00:32:32,399
My lady, you exaggerate.

475
00:32:32,480-->00:32:34,0
Let's speak plainly.

476
00:32:34,920-->00:32:37,599
I'm sure you came here today by order of the Empress.

477
00:32:38,599-->00:32:41,719
You've asked your questions, I've answered, and I have witnesses, too.

478
00:32:41,799-->00:32:43,960
You may take them with you if you wish.

479
00:32:44,40-->00:32:46,359
Otherwise, if you come to me with this matter again,

480
00:32:47,679-->00:32:50,600
I will absolutely crush you.

481
00:32:51,519-->00:32:54,120
My lady, I'll excuse myself now.

482
00:33:01,920-->00:33:03,319
Idiot! How careless!

483
00:33:13,559-->00:33:15,519
All of you must remember.

484
00:33:15,599-->00:33:21,479
Fuzi ran off by her own choice, slipped into the well and drowned.

485
00:33:22,480-->00:33:24,80
Yes, sir.

486
00:33:30,800-->00:33:34,319
Young mistress, you've had a severe shock.

487
00:33:36,880-->00:33:40,319
I saw something I shouldn't have.

488
00:33:40,399-->00:33:43,199
Then you must find a way to forget it.

489
00:33:45,319-->00:33:50,559
That day we met outside the palace, you made me a promise. Is it still valid?

490
00:33:50,640-->00:33:54,880
Of course. I'll always place you above all else.

491
00:33:56,799-->00:33:59,0
I'm at your command.

492
00:34:04,920-->00:34:07,480
I refuse to serve His Majesty in bed.

493
00:34:13,479-->00:34:16,239
It is against my wishes as well.

494
00:34:17,599-->00:34:21,79
But since you're already here, it is only a matter of time.

495
00:34:21,159-->00:34:24,880
For the sake of your future, it should happen as soon as possible.

496
00:34:25,520-->00:34:29,280
But I'm really scared. If I serve His Majesty at this time–

497
00:34:30,719-->00:34:33,719
I know I am not destined to spend the rest of my life with you,

498
00:34:34,320-->00:34:36,519
but keeping you from harm for the rest of your life

499
00:34:36,599-->00:34:38,559
is another way to keep my promise.

500
00:34:39,679-->00:34:42,159
Since you want good repose to make a full recovery,

501
00:34:42,760-->00:34:44,440
I'll prepare a special prescription

502
00:34:44,519-->00:34:46,359
which will restore you to health in some time.

503
00:34:49,719-->00:34:51,640
Your Majesty, please select a concubine.

504
00:34:53,40-->00:34:55,39
Where's the name board for Attendant Wan?

505
00:34:55,639-->00:34:56,719
Your Majesty,

506
00:34:56,800-->00:34:59,599
the Imperial Medical Bureau reported this afternoon

507
00:34:59,680-->00:35:03,360
that Attendant Wan suffered a shock which has led her to fall ill.

508
00:35:03,439-->00:35:05,360
She needs isolation and rest.

509
00:35:05,440-->00:35:06,760
Suffered a shock?

510
00:35:07,440-->00:35:11,360
Consort Hua's servant Fuzi fell into the well for unknown reasons.

511
00:35:11,439-->00:35:14,480
Attendant Wan saw the dead body by accident.

512
00:35:14,559-->00:35:16,159
Consort Hua.

513
00:35:18,320-->00:35:20,280
LADY SHEN

514
00:35:22,840-->00:35:25,79
Congratulations, Lady Shen.

515
00:35:27,400-->00:35:31,320
His Majesty has chosen you to serve him in bed.

516
00:35:32,120-->00:35:34,39
Among the newly selected concubines,

517
00:35:34,119-->00:35:38,320
you're the first to win His Majesty's favor.

518
00:35:38,400-->00:35:40,560
But I–

519
00:35:40,639-->00:35:43,519
This is Madam Liu, who is in charge of the imperial bedchamber.

520
00:35:44,199-->00:35:48,840
Young mistress, she will tell you all the rules.

521
00:35:48,920-->00:35:53,679
Shortly after, the Imperial Favor Carriage will arrive to take you to Yangxin Hall.

522
00:35:56,639-->00:35:58,879
SU PEISHENG

523
00:35:58,960-->00:36:00,840
Your Majesty, Lady Shen has arrived.

524
00:36:01,559-->00:36:02,599
Carry her in.

525
00:36:37,0-->00:36:38,599
Your Majesty.

526
00:36:41,520-->00:36:45,760
Attendant Wan is as pretty as a flower, but she's also as timid as a mouse.

527
00:36:45,840-->00:36:48,520
As she lacks resolve, her beauty is vain and useless.

528
00:36:48,599-->00:36:49,879
CONSORT QI

529
00:36:49,960-->00:36:53,559
She saw that bloody scene when she was new here. Of course she's scared.

530
00:36:54,120-->00:36:57,119
You should know very well how arrogant Consort Hua has become.

531
00:36:57,199-->00:36:58,199
On the day she came to visit me,

532
00:36:58,280-->00:37:00,239
even though you're the Third Prince's mother,

533
00:37:00,319-->00:37:03,719
you greeted her before she greeted you.

534
00:37:04,800-->00:37:08,599
Your Highness, the Third Prince is not His Majesty's favorite.

535
00:37:09,199-->00:37:11,920
And His Majesty isn't fond of me.

536
00:37:12,0-->00:37:13,599
I'm growing old.

537
00:37:13,679-->00:37:17,960
But Consort Hua is young and pretty. She also has the Nian family behind her.

538
00:37:18,560-->00:37:22,119
My own First Prince and the late Empress's Second Prince both died young.

539
00:37:22,199-->00:37:23,959
Now the Third Prince is the eldest son.

540
00:37:24,760-->00:37:29,239
You have higher status than Consort Hua. She has not given birth to a child.

541
00:37:31,39-->00:37:32,599
What you say may be true,

542
00:37:32,679-->00:37:35,679
but His Majesty doesn't like the Third Prince.

543
00:37:35,760-->00:37:38,880
If His Majesty doesn't like him, then you should try to change his mind.

544
00:37:40,799-->00:37:42,280
Even you show such weakness.

545
00:37:42,679-->00:37:44,639
No wonder the Third Prince failed to make progress.

546
00:37:49,519-->00:37:52,239
Do these flowers please you?

547
00:37:52,319-->00:37:55,560
I passed by the greenhouse yesterday, and saw they had come into full bloom.

548
00:37:55,639-->00:37:57,679
So I had them sent to you.

549
00:37:57,760-->00:38:00,119
I like them very much. Thank you, Your Majesty.

550
00:38:00,800-->00:38:03,960
I see. There are chrysanthemums embroidered on your dress.

551
00:38:05,159-->00:38:07,40
Why are you so fond of them?

552
00:38:07,119-->00:38:09,599
"They would rather die on the branch retaining their scent

553
00:38:09,679-->00:38:12,119
than be scattered on the cold wind."

554
00:38:12,199-->00:38:15,280
I love them because they have integrity.

555
00:38:15,360-->00:38:16,639
They do have integrity.

556
00:38:17,399-->00:38:21,0
I like them because they're the only flowers that bloom in fall.

557
00:38:21,79-->00:38:23,119
They do not wish to compete with the others.

558
00:38:23,199-->00:38:26,600
Only when you can endure loneliness, may you enjoy happiness forever.

559
00:38:27,519-->00:38:29,919
I've learned from His Majesty.

560
00:38:34,239-->00:38:37,719
Changxi Hall. The name sounds like the study hall of an old scholar.

561
00:38:38,559-->00:38:43,0
Since you favor chrysanthemums, let's rename it Cunju Hall.

562
00:38:48,160-->00:38:49,760
My lady, look at those chrysanthemums.

563
00:38:49,839-->00:38:52,919
Never in my life have I seen green chrysanthemums.

564
00:38:52,999-->00:38:54,719
They're quite special indeed.

565
00:38:55,399-->00:38:57,519
Look, the greenhouse workers are in such a hurry.

566
00:38:57,600-->00:39:00,159
I bet they're delivering them to our palace.

567
00:39:00,959-->00:39:03,880
Since they're gifts for me, then tell them to stop.

568
00:39:03,960-->00:39:06,239
- Let us have a look first. - Yes, my lady.

569
00:39:06,320-->00:39:07,599
Come here.

570
00:39:12,679-->00:39:14,79
I greet Consort Hua.

571
00:39:14,159-->00:39:16,159
It's due to your efforts that we may see such rare flowers.

572
00:39:16,239-->00:39:18,39
Just put them here.

573
00:39:20,640-->00:39:24,39
Consort Hua, these chrysanthemums–

574
00:39:24,120-->00:39:25,239
Speak.

575
00:39:25,320-->00:39:28,239
They are to be taken to Cunju Hall.

576
00:39:33,239-->00:39:34,719
Then carry out your orders.

577
00:39:34,800-->00:39:36,919
Please forgive me, Consort Hua.

578
00:39:38,959-->00:39:40,520
Please forgive me, my lady.

579
00:39:41,360-->00:39:43,119
Slap yourself.

580
00:39:43,199-->00:39:46,719
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

581
00:39:51,400-->00:39:56,280
Master, Attendant Wan has been ill two months and isn't recovering.

582
00:39:56,360-->00:39:57,800
XIAO YINZI

583
00:39:57,879-->00:40:01,599
Two days ago, I heard Doctor Wen say she'll need more time to recover.

584
00:40:01,679-->00:40:03,39
Her beauty may have been ravaged by the sickness.

585
00:40:03,119-->00:40:04,719
She cannot serve His Majesty.

586
00:40:04,800-->00:40:07,760
That's why we've become the lowest among all the servants.

587
00:40:07,840-->00:40:09,920
We should not bury our future and die with her.

588
00:40:11,439-->00:40:13,400
Master, please lead us.

589
00:40:14,199-->00:40:17,199
We can't serve you any longer, young mistress.

590
00:40:17,280-->00:40:19,800
What happened? Just tell me.

591
00:40:21,479-->00:40:23,520
The Imperial Household Department just informed me

592
00:40:23,599-->00:40:28,400
that Concubine Li of Qixiang Palace has requested for me to serve her.

593
00:40:30,440-->00:40:31,760
I see.

594
00:40:32,360-->00:40:36,559
Concubine Li is a kind mistress. You're fortunate to have this chance.

595
00:40:37,599-->00:40:38,599
Huanbi.

596
00:40:39,800-->00:40:42,639
- Summon everyone. - Yes, mistress.

597
00:40:48,599-->00:40:51,280
I've been ill for nearly two months.

598
00:40:51,800-->00:40:53,599
Commotion is not good for my recovery.

599
00:40:53,679-->00:40:55,920
And I don't need so many servants to serve me.

600
00:40:55,999-->00:40:58,119
So I ask you.

601
00:40:58,199-->00:41:00,440
If anyone desires to go,

602
00:41:01,80-->00:41:03,560
he may receive a final payment from Huanbi and simply leave.

603
00:41:03,639-->00:41:06,199
Let us congratulate Eunuch Kang and Eunuch Yin.

604
00:41:06,280-->00:41:08,520
They've been requested by Concubine Li.

605
00:41:08,599-->00:41:10,360
They will leave as soon as they've packed.

606
00:41:10,439-->00:41:12,719
I'm just a servant. I had no choice.

607
00:41:13,519-->00:41:18,599
A fine excuse. I don't believe you're being forced to go.

608
00:41:18,679-->00:41:21,40
Your words conceal your true intent.

609
00:41:21,119-->00:41:22,360
Liuzhu.

610
00:41:22,440-->00:41:25,760
Eunuch Kang has served with true loyalty. He will do the same for any mistress.

611
00:41:26,439-->00:41:27,760
Huanbi, give him the payment.

612
00:41:31,440-->00:41:34,239
Eunuch Kang, farewell.

613
00:41:36,840-->00:41:39,639
Eunuch Yin, here you are.

614
00:41:40,560-->00:41:44,840
If you are as loyal as your master, Kang, you'll have a bright future indeed.

615
00:41:48,239-->00:41:49,839
Thank you, young mistress.

616
00:41:58,840-->00:42:02,199
Anyone who wishes may go with them. Today we still have some money to pay out.

617
00:42:02,280-->00:42:03,479
After today,

618
00:42:03,560-->00:42:06,760
Attendant Wan will report to the Empress, and you'll end up in hard labor.

619
00:42:06,840-->00:42:08,239
You must think it through.

620
00:42:08,920-->00:42:11,639
I don't have the wits to be of service to you, young mistress.

621
00:42:24,280-->00:42:27,119
Young mistress, I will follow you without a second thought.

622
00:42:29,320-->00:42:30,559
So will I, young mistress.

623
00:42:36,40-->00:42:38,679
You've done me a great favor. I'll never betray you.

624
00:42:39,440-->00:42:40,679
Why do you say that?

625
00:42:40,760-->00:42:42,840
My elder brother was ill with no one to care for him.

626
00:42:43,440-->00:42:47,79
Even in your illness, you were concerned and had Doctor Wen check on him.

627
00:42:47,159-->00:42:50,719
If not for you, my elder brother would not have made it.

628
00:42:51,640-->00:42:54,960
You've favored us so greatly, I will serve you with absolute loyalty.

629
00:42:55,39-->00:42:56,560
Not only in this life,

630
00:42:56,639-->00:42:57,800
XIAO YUNZI

631
00:42:57,879-->00:43:00,920
but also after I reincarnate as a cow. I'll carry you towards becoming a Buddha.

632
00:43:00,999-->00:43:02,439
Liar.

633
00:43:02,520-->00:43:04,159
I am most sincere.

634
00:43:10,880-->00:43:14,79
You've served a young mistress who has suffered long-term illness and disgrace.

635
00:43:14,159-->00:43:17,560
You have never enjoyed advantage, yet still you serve me with devotion.

636
00:43:18,840-->00:43:20,679
I receive more than I can repay.

637
00:43:22,639-->00:43:24,440
As long as I'm here,

638
00:43:25,199-->00:43:27,0
I will never let you be mistreated.

639
00:43:27,600-->00:43:29,400
Thank you, young mistress.

640
00:43:33,479-->00:43:37,360
The Emperor and the Empress arrive!

641
00:43:42,560-->00:43:46,760
Your Majesty, may peace be with you. Your Highness, may fortune be with you.

642
00:43:46,840-->00:43:50,199
Today is a family feast. No need to be formal. You may be seated.

643
00:43:50,280-->00:43:52,519
Thank you, Your Majesty.

644
00:43:53,239-->00:43:54,840
You always ask us to relax.

645
00:43:54,920-->00:43:57,840
But we must follow tradition, so formality is of the essence.

646
00:43:57,920-->00:43:59,519
MARQUESS GUO (YUNLI)

647
00:43:59,599-->00:44:00,599
Only my 17th Brother would say such a thing.

648
00:44:00,679-->00:44:01,999
He doesn't like formality.

649
00:44:03,199-->00:44:04,639
He hasn't run off and was not late today.

650
00:44:04,719-->00:44:07,480
That's already enough of an accomplishment.

651
00:44:09,639-->00:44:12,760
Tonight is the New Year's Eve gathering, how could I be late?

652
00:44:13,599-->00:44:15,0
First, a toast.

653
00:44:15,719-->00:44:19,639
May you enjoy long life, health and peace. May our country thrive in peace.

654
00:44:19,719-->00:44:20,719
Well said.

655
00:44:23,280-->00:44:27,159
Long live the Emperor!

656
00:44:36,239-->00:44:38,239
Jinxi, let me see that.

657
00:44:41,520-->00:44:43,559
Jinxi made this peacock showing its tail, it's so vivid.

658
00:44:43,640-->00:44:45,80
Very nice.

659
00:44:45,159-->00:44:48,239
But nothing like the image of the Gods of Harmony the young mistress made.

660
00:44:49,79-->00:44:50,519
Look, it's so lifelike.

661
00:44:50,600-->00:44:54,599
The Gods of Harmony don't really exist. It came entirely from my imagination.

662
00:44:55,199-->00:44:57,199
I've heard that some can make paper cutouts

663
00:44:57,280-->00:44:59,239
that look identical to an actual person.

664
00:44:59,320-->00:45:02,800
Young mistress, there is a master of the art of paper cutouts among us.

665
00:45:02,880-->00:45:06,280
I just saw Xiao Yunzi make a portrait of you and hide it in his sleeve.

666
00:45:06,360-->00:45:07,800
- Really? - Don't talk nonsense.

667
00:45:07,880-->00:45:10,199
Xiao Yunzi, be generous. Let me have a look.

668
00:45:10,280-->00:45:11,600
Let's see.

669
00:45:18,599-->00:45:19,760
So alike.

670
00:45:20,360-->00:45:23,320
Xiao Yunzi, you're so skillful.

671
00:45:23,400-->00:45:25,480
I'm clumsy, unable to make a cutout of your beautiful face.

672
00:45:25,560-->00:45:28,479
I'll make a better one next time, young mistress.

673
00:45:38,920-->00:45:40,799
Your Majesty, I propose a toast.

674
00:45:45,239-->00:45:46,480
Where's Attendant Wan?

675
00:45:48,199-->00:45:50,79
Attendant Wan hasn't recovered yet.

676
00:45:50,159-->00:45:52,840
It's freezing cold, so I told her to rest at her residence.

677
00:45:55,520-->00:45:58,559
I heard of a custom in the palace.

678
00:45:58,640-->00:46:02,320
On New Year's Eve, if you place something dear to you on a branch,

679
00:46:02,399-->00:46:04,400
the higher the better, then you can make a wish.

680
00:46:05,199-->00:46:06,760
If you truly like this little portrait,

681
00:46:06,840-->00:46:09,599
you may put it on the tree in the courtyard.

682
00:46:09,679-->00:46:12,199
And then you may wish for good fortune next year.

683
00:46:12,280-->00:46:14,119
It will also be a great honor to Xiao Yunzi.

684
00:46:14,199-->00:46:16,80
Good idea.

685
00:46:16,159-->00:46:17,239
I'll go see.

686
00:46:18,160-->00:46:19,600
Young mistress, you shouldn't.

687
00:46:19,679-->00:46:21,919
You haven't fully recovered. It's not good to go outside.

688
00:46:22,0-->00:46:24,320
If the Empress learns of this, she will blame us.

689
00:46:24,399-->00:46:25,760
He's right.

690
00:46:26,360-->00:46:27,960
It's late at night.

691
00:46:28,40-->00:46:30,280
Everyone is enjoying the feast.

692
00:46:31,39-->00:46:34,560
I'll put on my cloak before going out. It will keep me warm and concealed.

693
00:46:35,159-->00:46:38,359
I've been ill for so long. It's time I took a walk.

694
00:46:38,959-->00:46:41,239
- Young mistress. - Don't follow me.

695
00:46:41,320-->00:46:42,719
I wish to go alone.

696
00:46:42,800-->00:46:44,760
Anyone who dares detain me further,

697
00:46:45,599-->00:46:49,519
will have to kneel on the ground this whole snowy night.

698
00:46:49,600-->00:46:51,199
Young mistress!

699
00:47:20,440-->00:47:23,239
Have the red plums in the Imperial Garden blossomed yet?

700
00:47:24,920-->00:47:26,839
They blossom, even with the snow.

701
00:47:26,920-->00:47:28,159
I wish to see it.

702
00:47:28,760-->00:47:31,760
It's freezing cold outside. You should care for your health.

703
00:47:31,840-->00:47:34,560
They blossom in the snow. How could I miss such a sight?

704
00:47:35,320-->00:47:37,159
Don't try to stop me.

705
00:47:38,520-->00:47:39,880
Su Peisheng.

706
00:47:39,960-->00:47:41,119
Your Majesty.

707
00:47:41,760-->00:47:44,519
Let no one follow me. I wish to walk alone.

708
00:47:46,80-->00:47:47,399
I drank overmuch.

709
00:47:49,760-->00:47:51,719
- But Your Majesty– - Your Majesty.

710
00:47:51,800-->00:47:53,999
- Say no more. - Your Majesty.

711
00:47:54,80-->00:47:56,320
Your Majesty, where are you going?

712
00:48:02,159-->00:48:03,439
Brother Yunli.

713
00:48:04,479-->00:48:05,800
Brother Yunli.

714
00:48:08,440-->00:48:10,39
His Majesty forbade us to follow him.

715
00:48:10,120-->00:48:13,440
But it's dark outside and the path is slippery. Please accompany him.

716
00:48:15,480-->00:48:17,399
Why was the red plum placed here?

717
00:48:18,239-->00:48:20,159
Consort Hua knows nothing of the matter.

718
00:48:20,239-->00:48:23,159
It was she who was responsible for decorating the Imperial Feast.

719
00:48:24,80-->00:48:25,799
Don't worry, Your Highness. I'll follow him.

720
00:48:48,719-->00:48:50,119
Since we came to the palace,

721
00:48:50,199-->00:48:52,519
all have prayed to win His Majesty's favor.

722
00:48:53,400-->00:48:56,600
I first wish that my parents and sister be granted good health and fortune.

723
00:48:57,679-->00:49:02,760
I next wish that I may live peacefully in the palace for the rest of my life.

724
00:49:04,679-->00:49:06,679
There is endless strife in the harem.

725
00:49:06,760-->00:49:09,80
It is not easy to protect myself.

726
00:49:30,639-->00:49:34,360
The plum blossoms this year are just as beautiful as in the past.

727
00:49:35,840-->00:49:38,480
"Each year and every year, the blossoms return anew.

728
00:49:38,559-->00:49:41,560
Each year and every year, the bloom of youth does not."

729
00:49:43,599-->00:49:46,520
Surely Consort Hua didn't intend to decorate with so many plum blossoms.

730
00:49:48,119-->00:49:49,960
It is my own problem.

731
00:49:50,879-->00:49:54,760
It all took place before Consort Hua became my concubine. She knows nothing.

732
00:49:54,840-->00:49:57,119
It has been many years. You still haven't let it go?

733
00:49:59,639-->00:50:01,639
Let what go?

734
00:50:05,119-->00:50:09,639
Now I expect it will grow warmer after early spring.

735
00:50:10,439-->00:50:13,519
You may come visit me. We'll converse and play chess together.

736
00:50:15,199-->00:50:17,199
Young mistress, please be patient.

737
00:50:17,280-->00:50:21,40
His Majesty is still occupied with his daily affairs, he'll come later.

738
00:50:21,640-->00:50:25,480
Shortly, we will carry you to the bedchamber.

739
00:50:25,560-->00:50:29,519
Young mistress, you may lie on the bed and await His Majesty.

740
00:50:32,39-->00:50:34,879
Young mistress, what's the matter?

741
00:50:35,760-->00:50:39,639
Now I'm somehow frightened.

742
00:50:39,719-->00:50:42,39
Don't be scared.

743
00:51:17,639-->00:51:18,639
What is it?

744
00:51:19,760-->00:51:22,0
I'm–

745
00:51:23,480-->00:51:26,639
Did Madam Liu teach you the rules of serving in bed?

746
00:51:31,199-->00:51:33,960
I don't like to force anyone. Some other day.

747
00:51:34,479-->00:51:35,879
Su Peisheng.

748
00:51:38,239-->00:51:39,719
Your Majesty.

749
00:51:39,800-->00:51:41,400
Take her away.

750
00:51:42,119-->00:51:44,519
Bring Second Attendant Yu.

751
00:51:45,840-->00:51:47,239
Yes, Your Majesty.

752
00:51:52,880-->00:51:56,400
What a misfortune. I've never performed such a lousy errand.

753
00:51:56,479-->00:51:59,559
A concubine who was carried into Yangxin Hall is carried out untouched.

754
00:53:07,800-->00:53:09,719
Who are you, sire?

755
00:53:13,79-->00:53:14,79
Guess.

756
00:53:15,999-->00:53:17,239
You're one of the nobles?

757
00:53:20,360-->00:53:22,239
Have you heard of Marquess Guo?

758
00:53:23,520-->00:53:25,160
Are you really Marquess Guo?

759
00:53:27,119-->00:53:30,679
Have you ever seen me before?

760
00:53:33,439-->00:53:37,239
Since coming to the palace, I have met neither His Majesty nor His Lordship.

761
00:53:40,799-->00:53:44,480
Then how do you know I'm not Marquess Guo?

762
00:53:47,760-->00:53:49,760
Your age does not seem to match his.

763
00:53:49,839-->00:53:54,719
A person's appearance doesn't always match his age.

764
00:53:55,760-->00:53:58,199
It is as you say.

765
00:53:58,280-->00:54:00,239
I'm a First Attendant from the Zhen family,

766
00:54:00,319-->00:54:01,599
I bow in respect before His Lordship.

767
00:54:01,679-->00:54:04,479
You're the First Attendant who has been ill?

768
00:54:05,440-->00:54:08,880
How does my lord know about the trifles of the harem?

769
00:54:08,959-->00:54:13,440
I heard it from my imperial sister-in-law.

770
00:54:14,159-->00:54:19,0
At New Year's Eve, His Majesty mentioned it. And I was there.

771
00:54:19,600-->00:54:21,519
I see.

772
00:54:22,959-->00:54:24,999
Are you recovering well?

773
00:54:25,880-->00:54:28,0
Why didn't you dress warmly before going out?

774
00:54:28,840-->00:54:30,959
Thank you for your consideration. I'm feeling well.

775
00:54:31,959-->00:54:34,280
Liuzhu, this is Marquess Guo.

776
00:54:37,480-->00:54:39,80
I wish you all blessings, my lord.

777
00:54:40,360-->00:54:42,639
You were just playing "Apricot Blossoms Against the Sky."

778
00:54:43,599-->00:54:45,199
It matches the setting so well.

779
00:54:45,719-->00:54:49,39
I play quite poorly. Please forgive my lack of skill.

780
00:54:49,119-->00:54:50,919
Your performance was excellent.

781
00:54:52,119-->00:54:54,440
But when you started to play the line,

782
00:54:54,520-->00:54:58,559
"Green shoots spring from the shoal, and still I am far from home,"

783
00:54:58,640-->00:55:00,880
the tone of your flute faltered a little,

784
00:55:01,719-->00:55:03,880
as if you were stifling a sob.

785
00:55:04,479-->00:55:06,679
Was it due to homesickness?

786
00:55:08,760-->00:55:11,280
"The smallest mistake a musician made, Zhou Yu would notice."

787
00:55:11,360-->00:55:14,360
You have a good ear for music, comparable to Zhou Yu's.

788
00:55:17,360-->00:55:18,840
We haven't–

789
00:55:20,519-->00:55:23,719
I haven't heard such beautiful flute playing or a very long time.

790
00:55:24,399-->00:55:26,880
Ever since Empress Chunyuan died,

791
00:55:26,960-->00:55:29,0
none has played so well as you.

792
00:55:29,79-->00:55:31,440
Your Lordship is too kind. I'm deeply humbled.

793
00:55:32,719-->00:55:35,199
I dare not compare myself to Empress Chunyuan.

794
00:55:37,880-->00:55:41,880
I must return to my residence. Enjoy the garden, my lord.

795
00:55:41,960-->00:55:43,400
Go ahead.

796
00:56:02,320-->00:56:04,119
Young mistress, you're back.

797
00:56:05,280-->00:56:06,320
Pei-er.

798
00:56:07,360-->00:56:10,439
Find a way to determine if Marquess Guo entered the palace today.

799
00:56:11,280-->00:56:12,280
Yes, mistress.

800
00:56:14,440-->00:56:18,119
You don't believe the man who appreciated the music was Marquess Guo?

801
00:56:19,920-->00:56:20,919
What do you think?

802
00:56:23,359-->00:56:25,439
Extra caution is always wise.

803
00:56:27,280-->00:56:29,79
May good fortune be with you, Your Majesty.

804
00:56:29,159-->00:56:30,760
- Rise. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

805
00:56:30,840-->00:56:33,39
Why have you come so early?

806
00:56:33,119-->00:56:36,199
This morning, you sent word that you had an authentic work of Wu Daozi.

807
00:56:36,280-->00:56:39,280
I couldn't wait to see it, so I came right away.

808
00:56:40,160-->00:56:42,400
Why so hurried? A painting cannot run away.

809
00:56:42,479-->00:56:44,719
A famous painting is just like a beautiful woman.

810
00:56:44,800-->00:56:46,199
I'll waste no time enjoying it.

811
00:56:46,280-->00:56:48,520
If you have such thirst for beauty, why haven't you married?

812
00:56:59,519-->00:57:00,519
Halt.

813
00:57:01,359-->00:57:04,679
All of you will return to Yangxin Hall. I want to walk alone.

814
00:57:06,119-->00:57:09,39
- You want to go higher? - A little bit.

815
00:57:10,280-->00:57:12,119
I knew you would be scared.

816
00:57:16,760-->00:57:18,599
It'll be your turn later.

817
00:57:18,679-->00:57:21,199
Great. I'm afraid of nothing.

818
00:57:35,559-->00:57:37,680
Well, Liuzhu. You dare play tricks behind my back.

819
00:57:40,360-->00:57:41,360
Young mistress.

820
00:57:42,479-->00:57:43,840
I greet His Lordship.

821
00:57:44,440-->00:57:46,39
Are you all right, young mistress?

822
00:57:47,399-->00:57:49,0
Why so timid now?

823
00:57:49,560-->00:57:52,159
You were as brave as a heroine before.

824
00:57:52,239-->00:57:53,679
I was discourteous.

825
00:57:53,760-->00:57:57,239
I didn't know that His Lordship enjoyed standing at others' backs in silence.

826
00:57:58,0-->00:58:00,880
So you blame me for my rudeness.

827
00:58:01,480-->00:58:03,479
As I was passing by this place,

828
00:58:04,479-->00:58:07,280
I recalled the flute music you played the other day.

829
00:58:07,360-->00:58:10,360
I hoped I would meet you and have a chance to hear it once more.

830
00:58:11,719-->00:58:14,199
But I didn't bring the flute with me today.

831
00:58:15,760-->00:58:17,800
Then I must wait for next time.

832
00:58:28,239-->00:58:30,199
This spot is filled with apricot blossoms.

833
00:58:31,239-->00:58:34,760
The song you played also refers to apricot blossoms.

834
00:58:34,839-->00:58:37,0
Are you very fond of them?

835
00:58:37,80-->00:58:40,840
The apricot blossom is beautiful, but the fruit is exceedingly sour.

836
00:58:40,920-->00:58:42,840
Furthermore, the stone is bitter.

837
00:58:42,920-->00:58:47,79
If life begins in happiness but ends in misery, what is the purpose?

838
00:58:48,599-->00:58:49,879
I'd rather it resemble the pine and cedar.

839
00:58:50,239-->00:58:53,520
They're evergreen, but lack flower and fruit.

840
00:58:53,599-->00:58:57,199
I've never heard such a point of view. It's quite innovative and unique.

841
00:58:59,79-->00:59:02,159
I just spoke nonsense. Please forgive my silliness.

842
00:59:02,999-->00:59:06,640
I was overly intrusive and rude today.

843
00:59:08,639-->00:59:10,360
I have two music scores.

844
00:59:11,79-->00:59:13,320
Five days from now, at this hour,

845
00:59:13,400-->00:59:16,199
I'll share them with you in this place.

846
00:59:16,280-->00:59:18,960
I hope that you will be here.

847
00:59:21,79-->00:59:23,999
It is better to accept deferentially than to decline courteously.

848
00:59:27,199-->00:59:28,400
Your Majesty.

849
00:59:28,479-->00:59:29,719
Halt.

850
00:59:32,239-->00:59:34,239
The Empress Dowager requires you at Shoukang Palace.

851
00:59:37,519-->00:59:39,120
He didn't come.

852
00:59:41,639-->00:59:44,119
You mean Marquess Guo, young mistress?

853
00:59:45,400-->00:59:46,999
How silly of me.

854
00:59:48,119-->00:59:49,719
He is a marquess.

855
00:59:50,840-->00:59:53,440
In such weather, of course he prefers to recite poetry at home.

856
00:59:53,520-->00:59:55,960
Why should he come to meet me?

857
00:59:56,960-->01:0:0,679
His invitation was just a whim, but I took it seriously.

858
01:0:1,280-->01:0:3,920
Young mistress, let's return.

859
01:0:6,119-->01:0:8,760
Don't get wet in the rain. Let's go.

860
01:0:27,960-->01:0:31,599
"Over the high mountain, a distant moon rises.

861
01:0:32,679-->01:0:35,919
Though the moon is small, it shines clear and bright.

862
01:0:37,719-->01:0:40,439
The one on my mind is far away from me.

863
01:0:41,280-->01:0:46,800
One day apart and already my heart is heavy."

864
01:0:46,999-->01:0:49,800
The sound of music lays bare the heart of the musician.

865
01:0:49,879-->01:0:53,440
Something is on your mind and haunts you.

866
01:1:6,0-->01:1:7,599
SECOND ATTENDANT YU

867
01:1:7,680-->01:1:9,320
It's her again.

868
01:1:9,399-->01:1:11,119
Who's there on the swing?

869
01:1:11,199-->01:1:12,960
Why didn't you come forward to bow in respect?

870
01:1:14,119-->01:1:16,920
My young mistress is First Attendant Wan of Suiyu Pavilion.

871
01:1:22,519-->01:1:26,239
Is there really an Attendant Wan? I've never heard of her.

872
01:1:26,320-->01:1:29,79
Young mistress, it is true that a First Attendant lives there.

873
01:1:29,159-->01:1:30,920
She has long been ill and seldom goes out.

874
01:1:36,119-->01:1:38,880
I am Second Attendant Yu. I bow in respect before Attendant Wan.

875
01:1:38,959-->01:1:39,960
Greetings.

876
01:1:41,960-->01:1:44,840
I'd like to offer some advice, Attendant Wan.

877
01:1:44,919-->01:1:48,160
If you are not well, then you should not be outdoors.

878
01:1:48,760-->01:1:52,280
Otherwise, your ill fortune may bring harm to others and you will be to blame.

879
01:1:52,360-->01:1:54,39
You are very kind.

880
01:1:55,160-->01:1:58,0
I would like to offer counsel to you in return.

881
01:1:59,440-->01:2:1,840
I await the wisdom of your words.

882
01:2:2,439-->01:2:6,0
It is said that His Majesty prefers those who are always courteous.

883
01:2:6,79-->01:2:10,239
But Attendant Yu, when you saw me here, you did not bow in respect.

884
01:2:10,320-->01:2:13,719
So I must ask you to greet me again.

885
01:2:14,360-->01:2:17,360
You're only a First Attendant who has never enjoyed the imperial favor.

886
01:2:17,439-->01:2:21,360
How dare you ask me to bow in respect. You don't deserve it.

887
01:2:22,199-->01:2:25,760
Young mistress, Attendant Wan is of higher rank.

888
01:2:25,840-->01:2:28,119
You serve me. How dare you take her side!

889
01:2:30,80-->01:2:35,159
You don't actually believe that your rank indicates your status, do you?

890
01:2:36,800-->01:2:42,719
Besides, your rank is only slightly above mine.

891
01:2:42,800-->01:2:45,80
Don't be overbearing.

892
01:2:45,760-->01:2:47,999
What if it is our desire

893
01:2:49,560-->01:2:52,959
that you bow in respect before Attendant Wan?

894
01:2:53,40-->01:2:55,239
May good fortune be with you, Your Majesty.

895
01:2:56,439-->01:2:58,719
Young mistress.

896
01:3:1,199-->01:3:4,560
I bow in respect before Your Majesty. May blessings and peace be with you.

897
01:3:4,639-->01:3:6,479
Your Majesty, may blessings and peace be with you.

898
01:3:6,559-->01:3:10,79
The other day, I did not intentionally break my promise and arrive late.

899
01:3:12,39-->01:3:14,559
Though I have been ill for several days,

900
01:3:14,639-->01:3:16,999
you have never left my thoughts.

901
01:3:17,79-->01:3:19,639
Did you come back to wait for me?

902
01:3:23,639-->01:3:25,39
You may rise.

903
01:3:25,639-->01:3:28,479
Help your young mistress up, she is still very weak.

904
01:3:28,559-->01:3:29,680
Young mistress.

905
01:3:31,480-->01:3:34,79
Your Majesty, I admit my fault.

906
01:3:34,159-->01:3:38,159
I offended Attendant Wan out of blindness and ignorance.

907
01:3:38,239-->01:3:41,280
I apologize to Attendant Wan and beg for her forgiveness.

908
01:3:41,360-->01:3:43,159
Your Majesty, please spare me this once.

909
01:3:44,559-->01:3:48,520
Your Majesty, "A fault confessed is half redressed."

910
01:3:48,599-->01:3:52,80
I believe Attendant Yu is truly regretful for her error.

911
01:3:52,680-->01:3:54,480
Your Majesty, please forgive her.

912
01:3:54,559-->01:3:57,679
Since Attendant Wan tries to intercede for you,

913
01:3:58,640-->01:4:1,400
it is not good for us to disappoint her.

914
01:4:1,479-->01:4:2,479
Su Peisheng.

915
01:4:5,760-->01:4:6,760
Your Majesty.

916
01:4:6,840-->01:4:9,560
Take note, Second Attendant Yu is hereby demoted.

917
01:4:10,280-->01:4:14,639
She must leave Zhongcui Palace and live someplace beyond our sight.

918
01:4:14,919-->01:4:15,919
Yes, sir.

919
01:4:16,320-->01:4:17,320
Your Majesty.

920
01:4:17,400-->01:4:21,560
You just said that Attendant Wan's rank was only slightly above yours.

921
01:4:22,199-->01:4:25,840
I now promote Attendant Wan to Noble Lady.

922
01:4:26,759-->01:4:31,320
Sire, promoting Attendant Wan before she serves you goes against custom.

923
01:4:31,400-->01:4:34,79
You are now so punctilious in performing your duty

924
01:4:34,159-->01:4:36,159
that you even interfere with my decrees?

925
01:4:36,239-->01:4:39,399
I dare not. I shall execute your order immediately.

926
01:4:41,759-->01:4:44,760
Are you so overjoyed that you forget to show your gratitude?

927
01:4:48,40-->01:4:51,79
Firstly, I have made no contribution to the nation.

928
01:4:51,159-->01:4:52,959
Secondly, I have begotten no heirs.

929
01:4:53,40-->01:4:56,360
I don't deserve to receive such great imperial grace.

930
01:4:56,440-->01:4:59,520
We declare that you deserve it, therefore, you absolutely deserve it.

931
01:4:59,599-->01:5:0,760
Rise.

932
01:5:0,839-->01:5:4,439
You drop to your knees so frequently, you completely neglect your own health.

933
01:5:7,400-->01:5:10,360
Young mistress, please return to your residence.

934
01:5:17,79-->01:5:18,199
I excuse myself.

935
01:5:36,239-->01:5:38,79
What's the matter? You're frightened?

936
01:5:51,360-->01:5:54,360
Your palm is sweaty. Are you nervous?

937
01:6:2,880-->01:6:4,40
You're the Emperor.

938
01:6:5,79-->01:6:8,0
You were not afraid of me before today. You were very bold.

939
01:6:9,759-->01:6:11,360
I didn't know you were the Emperor.

940
01:6:12,80-->01:6:13,679
But now I know.

941
01:6:14,320-->01:6:16,520
You are filled with regal dignity.

942
01:6:16,600-->01:6:19,879
I'm only an ordinary woman. I cannot help but fear you.

943
01:6:20,480-->01:6:22,360
Fear will bring overcaution.

944
01:6:22,439-->01:6:24,480
Overcaution will turn us into Emperor and his concubine.

945
01:6:26,0-->01:6:29,760
That rainy day, I did not intend to break my promise.

946
01:6:29,839-->01:6:32,240
I was only steps away from the Imperial Garden.

947
01:6:33,240-->01:6:37,360
But at that moment, the Empress Dowager called me to Shoukang Palace.

948
01:6:38,319-->01:6:42,679
When I returned to the Imperial Garden, you had already disappeared.

949
01:6:42,759-->01:6:45,119
I then caught cold and was ill for several days.

950
01:6:45,199-->01:6:47,160
Your Majesty, are you feeling better now?

951
01:6:47,240-->01:6:51,400
I stand before you in health talking with you now.

952
01:6:51,480-->01:6:53,79
Is it not so?

953
01:6:53,159-->01:6:54,959
I'm so foolish.

954
01:6:55,39-->01:6:56,319
Concern will cause confusion.

955
01:6:57,199-->01:7:0,679
In fact, I did come to the garden that day.

956
01:7:0,760-->01:7:2,199
Really?

957
01:7:2,800-->01:7:5,879
Did you get wet in the rain? Were you ill after that?

958
01:7:5,960-->01:7:7,639
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

959
01:7:8,519-->01:7:12,159
I also stand before you in health.

960
01:7:13,360-->01:7:15,0
All is well then.

961
01:7:15,720-->01:7:19,400
I have high esteem for you, simply because of your nature.

962
01:7:19,999-->01:7:22,319
If you were the same as the other concubines,

963
01:7:22,920-->01:7:26,119
I would not take my promise to you so seriously.

964
01:7:27,320-->01:7:31,520
I'm so foolish. I didn't realize it at all.

965
01:7:32,279-->01:7:35,280
I intentionally hid the truth from you. How would you know?

966
01:7:38,679-->01:7:40,280
Why is your hand so cold?

967
01:7:41,39-->01:7:43,520
Is it because of the wind?

968
01:7:44,639-->01:7:46,359
I don't feel cold.

969
01:7:46,440-->01:7:49,519
You've been out for a long time. Let me escort you back.

970
01:7:50,840-->01:7:53,719
Walking is tiring, I'll carry you instead.

971
01:7:53,800-->01:7:55,79
I dare not.

972
01:7:57,759-->01:7:59,239
Why not?

973
01:7:59,839-->01:8:1,800
Others will talk, Your Majesty.

974
01:8:3,919-->01:8:6,959
I must care for the one who is dear to me.

975
01:8:7,40-->01:8:10,39
If the others wish to talk, then let them talk as they will.

976
01:8:30,760-->01:8:32,160
We greet Your Majesty.

977
01:8:41,640-->01:8:43,359
My arms are sore.

978
01:8:44,479-->01:8:47,240
You mean to say that I am heavy?

979
01:8:47,319-->01:8:48,520
You are not heavy.

980
01:8:49,240-->01:8:52,239
I was concerned I would hurt you if I held you too tightly.

981
01:8:52,319-->01:8:54,439
But if I held you too loosely, you might fall.

982
01:8:55,79-->01:8:59,80
I was torn in that dilemma. That's why my arms are sore.

983
01:8:59,680-->01:9:1,239
You really know how to embarrass others.

984
01:9:6,560-->01:9:9,759
When Lady Wan was First Attendant, only you remained to serve her?

985
01:9:9,840-->01:9:10,840
Yes, sir.

986
01:9:11,479-->01:9:13,560
Peace and quiet is good for my recovery.

987
01:9:13,640-->01:9:15,999
And I really don't need so many servants.

988
01:9:16,680-->01:9:18,40
That's unreasonable.

989
01:9:20,120-->01:9:23,679
You've been promoted to Noble Lady. It's time you had more servants.

990
01:9:23,760-->01:9:27,39
Tomorrow I'll ask the Imperial Household Department to send you decent staff.

991
01:9:28,0-->01:9:29,479
Thank you, Your Majesty.

992
01:9:31,840-->01:9:33,240
She has already risen to Noble Lady.

993
01:9:33,319-->01:9:34,840
PEACE

994
01:9:34,920-->01:9:37,800
- His Majesty is very fond of her? - It seems so.

995
01:9:37,879-->01:9:39,759
But her promotion goes against custom.

996
01:9:39,840-->01:9:41,800
Your Highness, you must speak to His Majesty.

997
01:9:41,880-->01:9:43,919
Palace custom was established by our ancestors.

998
01:9:44,0-->01:9:48,199
The ancestors are called sons of heaven. And Son of Heaven refers to the Emperor.

999
01:9:48,279-->01:9:51,399
She's an extraordinary girl. It is just a matter of time.

1000
01:11:19,319-->01:11:21,120
Frightened?

1001
01:11:21,199-->01:11:24,239
Concubines are always frightened the first time they serve in bed.

1002
01:11:25,959-->01:11:27,800
I am not frightened.

1003
01:11:29,520-->01:11:31,919
Tonight is my wedding night.

1004
01:11:31,999-->01:11:33,719
I am terrified.

1005
01:11:34,680-->01:11:38,520
Madam Liu taught me how to serve the Emperor.

1006
01:11:39,79-->01:11:43,600
But she has never taught me how to serve my husband.

1007
01:11:49,999-->01:11:52,640
I've displeased you. Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

1008
01:12:9,679-->01:12:12,759
No one has ever spoken to me this way.

1009
01:12:14,119-->01:12:16,199
Since you regard me as your husband,

1010
01:12:16,800-->01:12:21,479
you need not be so cautious before your husband.

1011
01:12:40,120-->01:12:41,680
The night before last, she served.

1012
01:12:41,759-->01:12:42,959
LADY CAO – CONCUBINE LI

1013
01:12:43,39-->01:12:44,520
Last night, she served again.

1014
01:12:45,439-->01:12:47,999
This afternoon, she played chess with His Majesty.

1015
01:12:48,79-->01:12:50,359
She is at Yangxin Hall this very moment.

1016
01:12:50,960-->01:12:54,479
The minx. She always manages to entangle His Majesty.

1017
01:12:54,560-->01:12:56,959
Because His Majesty has allowed her to do so.

1018
01:12:57,39-->01:12:59,119
Others are unable to do the same.

1019
01:12:59,199-->01:13:2,79
SERVING RECORD

1020
01:13:5,120-->01:13:8,600
I bow in respect before Consort Hua. I bow in respect before Concubine Li.

1021
01:13:8,679-->01:13:11,80
- Rise. - Thank you, my lady.

1022
01:13:18,79-->01:13:21,439
It seems that Lady Shen has lost some weight.

1023
01:13:21,520-->01:13:24,159
Is it because His Majesty no longer calls on you these days?

1024
01:13:25,319-->01:13:26,560
It's not like that.

1025
01:13:26,640-->01:13:30,279
I've simply lost my appetite due to the sultry weather.

1026
01:13:32,439-->01:13:34,119
So that's it.

1027
01:13:34,199-->01:13:37,159
Now that Lady Wan enjoys His Majesty's favor,

1028
01:13:37,239-->01:13:39,279
I thought Lady Shen had grown uncomfortable.

1029
01:13:40,279-->01:13:41,280
I would not dare.

1030
01:13:43,359-->01:13:45,560
Lady Wan is intelligent and beautiful.

1031
01:13:45,639-->01:13:48,640
Being favored with imperial grace is only natural.

1032
01:13:48,719-->01:13:50,439
Were it any of the others, it would not matter.

1033
01:13:50,520-->01:13:53,159
But Lady Wan and Lady Shen are as close as sisters.

1034
01:13:53,760-->01:13:56,0
Why didn't you share this grace with your sister

1035
01:13:56,80-->01:13:58,280
when you enjoyed the favor exclusively?

1036
01:14:0,880-->01:14:4,399
Lady Wan has been busy serving His Majesty recently.

1037
01:14:4,479-->01:14:6,79
Lady Shen is unoccupied.

1038
01:14:6,159-->01:14:9,520
Do you have time to make a copy of the account book?

1039
01:14:9,600-->01:14:12,720
My lady, I will gladly comply with your command.

1040
01:14:16,800-->01:14:19,600
Did His Majesty choose her to serve him again tonight?

1041
01:14:19,680-->01:14:21,959
His Majesty has gone to Consort Qi's residence.

1042
01:14:22,40-->01:14:23,879
Why did he go to see her?

1043
01:14:23,959-->01:14:27,0
As long as it's not Lady Wan, it doesn't matter who it is.

1044
01:14:29,239-->01:14:31,160
What time is it now?

1045
01:14:32,399-->01:14:34,920
It's still early. The sky has just grown dark.

1046
01:14:36,159-->01:14:40,359
His Majesty has asked Lady Shen to learn how to read the account book.

1047
01:14:40,439-->01:14:42,959
Then I should teach her personally.

1048
01:14:43,39-->01:14:45,960
- Summon Lady Shen. - Yes, my lady.

1049
01:14:47,880-->01:14:50,439
The candles are flickering.

1050
01:14:50,520-->01:14:52,159
Blow out two of them.

1051
01:14:54,120-->01:14:55,120
Yes, my lady.

1052
01:14:59,119-->01:15:0,960
Young mistress, no need to wait up.

1053
01:15:1,39-->01:15:4,159
His Majesty has chosen Consort Qi and has gone to Changchun Palace.

1054
01:15:7,359-->01:15:8,400
It's fine.

1055
01:15:10,120-->01:15:14,199
By your voice, you sound relieved, and yet unhappy.

1056
01:15:14,800-->01:15:16,600
I'm confused as well.

1057
01:15:18,240-->01:15:19,960
I hoped that His Majesty would not come.

1058
01:15:21,40-->01:15:24,800
Yet when I find that he hasn't, I'm not happy at all.

1059
01:15:57,560-->01:16:0,839
For better or for worse, Lady Shen comes from a noble family.

1060
01:16:0,919-->01:16:3,40
Why is your handwriting so illegible?

1061
01:16:3,119-->01:16:6,320
The candlelight is too dim. I can't see clearly.

1062
01:16:6,399-->01:16:8,319
Please forgive me, my lady.

1063
01:16:8,400-->01:16:11,800
You've just copied the account book. You must know that expenses are heavy.

1064
01:16:13,80-->01:16:17,640
As the leader of all the concubines, I must set an example of frugality.

1065
01:16:18,520-->01:16:21,760
Besides, it is said that if your handwriting is truly good,

1066
01:16:22,359-->01:16:24,319
then you may write beautifully even in the dark.

1067
01:16:25,479-->01:16:28,720
Noble Lady, your excuse is not convincing at all.

1068
01:16:28,800-->01:16:32,79
Then I'll make another copy.

1069
01:16:32,160-->01:16:35,399
Go ahead. I'll take a nap.

1070
01:16:36,439-->01:16:41,119
Songzhi, the light is too bright, blow out two more candles.

1071
01:16:41,200-->01:16:42,680
Yes, my lady.

1072
01:16:48,359-->01:16:50,560
"Raindrops fall on Dongting Lake.

1073
01:16:51,599-->01:16:54,200
Fog shrouds the Imperial Mausoleum.

1074
01:16:54,279-->01:16:56,359
I await my husband, but he has not arrived.

1075
01:16:57,0-->01:16:58,640
The ripples in the lake are not–"

1076
01:16:59,239-->01:17:0,720
Young mistress, please stop.

1077
01:17:0,800-->01:17:3,520
The title is "Consort Xiang's Complaint." It's unpropitious.

1078
01:17:7,800-->01:17:8,959
Halt.

1079
01:17:15,199-->01:17:17,279
It's "Consort Xiang's Complaint."

1080
01:17:18,279-->01:17:20,359
I know nothing of that.

1081
01:17:21,840-->01:17:24,520
"It's clear that the song is full of worry and sorrow.

1082
01:17:25,159-->01:17:28,159
As if to complain that her lover has not yet returned."

1083
01:17:29,399-->01:17:31,840
I'm not by her side. That's why she laments.

1084
01:17:51,439-->01:17:55,120
I'm disquieted by the sound of your music.

1085
01:17:56,640-->01:17:58,720
May blessings and peace be with you, Your Majesty.

1086
01:17:58,800-->01:17:59,800
Rise.

1087
01:18:0,399-->01:18:2,240
Your Majesty, why are you here?

1088
01:18:2,319-->01:18:5,79
"I've grown careworn for thinking of my lover."

1089
01:18:5,159-->01:18:7,959
I've finally tasted that kind of feeling.

1090
01:18:14,199-->01:18:16,960
Your Majesty, I thought you were at Consort Qi's residence.

1091
01:18:17,40-->01:18:18,119
I've already seen her.

1092
01:18:20,79-->01:18:22,359
On the way back, I saw the beautiful moonlight.

1093
01:18:23,79-->01:18:25,279
I wanted to come see what you were doing.

1094
01:18:26,80-->01:18:30,80
Such wonderful music. I am fortunate not to have missed it.

1095
01:18:30,160-->01:18:34,159
Does eavesdropping befit the dignity of the Emperor?

1096
01:18:35,439-->01:18:37,479
You grow bolder and bolder.

1097
01:18:38,79-->01:18:40,79
As punishment, you must play another piece.

1098
01:18:43,479-->01:18:46,160
Which song would you like to hear, my dear?

1099
01:18:47,40-->01:18:48,479
What did you call me just now?

1100
01:18:49,600-->01:18:51,239
It was a slip of the tongue.

1101
01:18:51,320-->01:18:53,279
I love the way you just spoke to me.

1102
01:18:55,640-->01:18:58,39
Your birth name is Zhen Huan. What is your nickname?

1103
01:18:59,160-->01:19:1,39
I don't have a nickname.

1104
01:19:2,919-->01:19:5,799
Then I shall call you Huan Huan. Do you like it?

1105
01:19:7,79-->01:19:8,400
Huan Huan.

1106
01:19:14,360-->01:19:16,359
It's clear that Consort Hua made things difficult for you.

1107
01:19:16,439-->01:19:19,399
That account book was full of numbers and she dimmed the light intentionally.

1108
01:19:19,479-->01:19:21,399
One copy would be hard enough.

1109
01:19:21,479-->01:19:23,640
Young mistress, your eyes are red now.

1110
01:19:24,239-->01:19:27,479
I had no choice. Just because she is Consort Hua.

1111
01:19:28,520-->01:19:30,520
I'm so sorry for you.

1112
01:19:31,319-->01:19:34,79
I'm fine. I've already fought off the sleepiness.

1113
01:19:35,600-->01:19:39,600
Qianli Pond isn't far from here. Let's take a walk.

1114
01:19:39,679-->01:19:42,199
I've heard that His Majesty has added some lamps.

1115
01:19:42,280-->01:19:45,319
The red fish look much more beautiful at night.

1116
01:19:57,239-->01:19:59,119
We ran out of fish food.

1117
01:19:59,199-->01:20:1,439
Xiao Shi, get us some more.

1118
01:20:1,520-->01:20:2,880
Yes, mistress.

1119
01:20:6,159-->01:20:7,600
Young mistress, look.

1120
01:20:10,159-->01:20:13,280
Here you are, young mistress. I've been looking for you everywhere.

1121
01:20:13,359-->01:20:15,600
Why are you out so late at night?

1122
01:20:15,680-->01:20:17,680
Does Consort Hua have any instructions for me?

1123
01:20:17,760-->01:20:20,799
The Consort has received some fine ink sent from Huizhou as a tribute.

1124
01:20:20,879-->01:20:24,239
She wanted to share some with you, but you left so quickly.

1125
01:20:24,840-->01:20:27,119
Caiyue, go with Songzhi.

1126
01:20:27,199-->01:20:28,640
But you will be left alone–

1127
01:20:28,720-->01:20:30,399
Try to come back as soon as possible.

1128
01:20:31,199-->01:20:32,199
Yes, mistress.

1129
01:20:59,600-->01:21:1,80
Help–

1130
01:21:1,160-->01:21:2,560
Help me!

1131
01:21:3,319-->01:21:4,920
Help me!

1132
01:21:6,599-->01:21:9,120
I bow in respect before Your Majesty.

1133
01:21:9,200-->01:21:10,520
- Rise. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

1134
01:21:10,600-->01:21:12,159
How's Mei?

1135
01:21:12,880-->01:21:15,239
Lady Wan, Lady Shen is all right now.

1136
01:21:15,880-->01:21:18,799
But she took in a lot of water and had a terrible shock. She's unconscious.

1137
01:21:18,880-->01:21:19,879
CONCUBINE JING

1138
01:21:20,320-->01:21:21,520
JIANG CHENG

1139
01:21:21,599-->01:21:23,200
We have already made a prescription.

1140
01:21:23,279-->01:21:25,479
As long as Lady Shen follows our instructions,

1141
01:21:25,560-->01:21:27,399
she will recover very soon.

1142
01:21:29,160-->01:21:31,359
How did you serve your young mistress?

1143
01:21:31,439-->01:21:33,479
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

1144
01:21:33,560-->01:21:35,520
How did Lady Shen end up in the water?

1145
01:21:35,600-->01:21:36,959
I don't know.

1146
01:21:37,40-->01:21:38,720
Nonsense!

1147
01:21:38,800-->01:21:42,520
You're Lady Shen's closest servants, how can you know nothing about it?

1148
01:21:42,600-->01:21:44,839
It's true. We really know nothing.

1149
01:21:44,919-->01:21:48,319
She was feeding fish at Qianli Pond, I went to get more food.

1150
01:21:48,399-->01:21:50,560
On the way, I heard shouts that she'd fallen in.

1151
01:21:50,640-->01:21:51,920
And Caiyue?

1152
01:21:51,999-->01:21:53,0
CAIYUE

1153
01:21:53,79-->01:21:56,80
Songzhi said that Consort Hua wanted to give her some fine ink,

1154
01:21:56,159-->01:21:58,640
she'd forgotten it earlier, and asked me to go fetch it.

1155
01:21:59,279-->01:22:1,600
So when Lady Shen fell in the water,

1156
01:22:1,680-->01:22:3,680
there was no one by her side?

1157
01:22:4,240-->01:22:7,79
Your Majesty, Consort Hua is here.

1158
01:22:8,840-->01:22:11,520
It's late at night. Why have you come?

1159
01:22:11,600-->01:22:14,80
I heard that Lady Shen nearly drowned, so I came in a hurry.

1160
01:22:14,600-->01:22:16,399
Is she recovering now?

1161
01:22:17,160-->01:22:19,999
Useless servants! How did you serve your young mistress?

1162
01:22:20,79-->01:22:21,439
It worries His Majesty.

1163
01:22:22,40-->01:22:25,39
Servants like them are only a burden to Lady Shen.

1164
01:22:25,120-->01:22:27,839
I suggest that they be sent to the Office of Punishment.

1165
01:22:31,880-->01:22:33,640
Please forgive them, my lady.

1166
01:22:33,719-->01:22:36,239
I know Consort Hua is expert at dispensing rewards and punishment.

1167
01:22:36,320-->01:22:39,679
But Caiyue and Xiao Shi have served Mei all along.

1168
01:22:39,759-->01:22:42,80
If they're sent to the Office of Punishment now,

1169
01:22:42,159-->01:22:45,399
Mei will be left without any reliable servants by her side.

1170
01:22:45,999-->01:22:49,999
They failed to keep Lady Shen safe. Why bother to keep them by her side?

1171
01:22:51,40-->01:22:54,159
Besides, Qianli Pond is less than a hundred paces from Yikun Palace.

1172
01:22:54,239-->01:22:59,39
It took place near my residence. How can I let them off easily?

1173
01:22:59,119-->01:23:0,720
That's precisely why I'm concerned.

1174
01:23:0,800-->01:23:2,560
Because the accident took place near Yikun Palace,

1175
01:23:3,279-->01:23:5,999
it could damage your prestige, others may think that's why you're upset.

1176
01:23:6,79-->01:23:8,679
That you don't truly care if Lady Shen nearly drowned.

1177
01:23:8,760-->01:23:11,600
These servants are insignificant, but your reputation is of great importance.

1178
01:23:11,680-->01:23:13,280
Consort Hua should think twice.

1179
01:23:14,800-->01:23:16,640
I agree with Lady Wan.

1180
01:23:18,399-->01:23:21,199
Let's make the decision after Lady Shen wakes up.

1181
01:23:21,799-->01:23:25,759
It will not be too late to send them to the Office of Punishment at that time.

1182
01:23:27,399-->01:23:30,880
I have another suggestion. I don't know if it's proper to state it.

1183
01:23:30,960-->01:23:32,399
Speak.

1184
01:23:33,240-->01:23:35,760
We still don't know what happened before Mei fell in the water.

1185
01:23:35,840-->01:23:37,439
But the guards didn't respond in time.

1186
01:23:37,520-->01:23:40,959
That's why she took in so much water and fell unconscious.

1187
01:23:41,39-->01:23:42,720
In my view,

1188
01:23:42,800-->01:23:45,919
it would be better to replace the guards at Yikun Palace.

1189
01:23:46,719-->01:23:49,720
It is Mei who suffers this time. But if there were another incident,

1190
01:23:49,799-->01:23:52,760
and Consort Hua became the next victim, what would we do?

1191
01:23:52,840-->01:23:55,800
Lady Wan just argued that we should let them make up for their mistakes.

1192
01:23:55,880-->01:23:59,279
Then why did you suggest replacing the guards at my palace?

1193
01:23:59,360-->01:24:2,880
It seems that your suggestion is partial.

1194
01:24:3,479-->01:24:5,359
It is for your own good, my lady.

1195
01:24:6,399-->01:24:8,439
His Majesty cherishes you greatly.

1196
01:24:8,520-->01:24:11,839
How could His Majesty let those careless servants protect your palace

1197
01:24:11,920-->01:24:14,399
and leave you endangered without misgivings?

1198
01:24:14,479-->01:24:18,840
Besides, being replaced is not a punishment for the guards.

1199
01:24:20,120-->01:24:21,999
Safety is the most important thing.

1200
01:24:23,200-->01:24:26,200
We can never let this happen again.

1201
01:24:27,520-->01:24:29,560
I'll ask Su Peisheng to replace them with

1202
01:24:30,360-->01:24:33,880
highly capable guards to protect Yikun Palace.

1203
01:24:33,960-->01:24:35,760
Only then will I rest easy.

1204
01:24:37,640-->01:24:40,159
How dare she interfere with my affairs!

1205
01:24:40,239-->01:24:41,640
Do not worry, my lady.

1206
01:24:42,239-->01:24:46,239
His Majesty favors her now. Many people hate her for that.

1207
01:24:47,279-->01:24:50,79
Who is serving Yu now?

1208
01:24:50,159-->01:24:52,239
She has lost the Emperor's favor, and become bad-tempered.

1209
01:24:52,319-->01:24:54,879
Even her own maid has left her after being beaten.

1210
01:24:54,959-->01:24:56,280
The wretch lives on her own now.

1211
01:24:56,800-->01:24:59,919
Your servant Kang Luhai is utterly useless.

1212
01:25:0,0-->01:25:1,999
Is his apprentice loyal to you?

1213
01:25:2,79-->01:25:4,279
You mean Xiao Yinzi, my lady?

1214
01:25:5,159-->01:25:8,760
He is not as cunning and devious as his master. Somewhat reliable.

1215
01:25:10,0-->01:25:12,199
Send him to serve Yu.

1216
01:25:17,479-->01:25:18,640
Mei.

1217
01:25:18,719-->01:25:20,320
Huan.

1218
01:25:20,399-->01:25:22,720
Someone tried to kill me.

1219
01:25:25,239-->01:25:28,960
Mei, did you see his face clearly?

1220
01:25:31,39-->01:25:35,120
The only one who could do something like this–

1221
01:25:40,680-->01:25:43,800
But Qianli Pond is so close to Yikun Palace.

1222
01:25:44,600-->01:25:48,119
If she wanted to play a dirty trick on me, she wouldn't do it on her own territory.

1223
01:25:48,199-->01:25:50,840
She should know how to avoid arousing suspicion.

1224
01:25:51,479-->01:25:53,200
It's worth the risk.

1225
01:25:53,879-->01:25:54,879
Others would not suspect that

1226
01:25:54,959-->01:25:57,359
she'd play such a dirty trick in her own territory.

1227
01:25:57,439-->01:25:59,39
You have the Emperor's favor.

1228
01:25:59,680-->01:26:3,199
She was afraid our strength would grow to the point that it's hard to control us.

1229
01:26:4,920-->01:26:6,959
So she had to get rid of one of us first.

1230
01:26:7,40-->01:26:12,319
Then we would be too weak to fight against her.

1231
01:26:17,79-->01:26:19,720
This ink was received from the Governor of Shandong as a tribute.

1232
01:26:19,799-->01:26:21,560
This ink stick may be of good quality,

1233
01:26:21,640-->01:26:25,159
but it can never compare with those in Yikun Palace.

1234
01:26:26,239-->01:26:29,680
Do you really plan to do nothing about Lady Shen's accident?

1235
01:26:30,279-->01:26:33,520
You saw Consort Hua hold her head high when she just paid a visit to me.

1236
01:26:33,600-->01:26:37,520
That means His Majesty has already made up his mind.

1237
01:26:38,879-->01:26:41,920
Even if I wanted to do something, I'm unable to do anything about it.

1238
01:26:42,0-->01:26:45,39
In any case, we all know who must be responsible for this.

1239
01:26:45,999-->01:26:48,719
Sometimes we have to settle a matter by leaving it unresolved.

1240
01:26:50,640-->01:26:55,200
"All good things must come to an end."

1241
01:26:55,279-->01:26:59,720
Such as the good days when the late Emperor and I had just met.

1242
01:27:0,520-->01:27:4,960
I thought my devout prayers had been heard by the heavens.

1243
01:27:5,40-->01:27:8,600
God had granted me the finest man in the world,

1244
01:27:8,679-->01:27:11,159
and I could remain by his side as long as I lived.

1245
01:27:13,720-->01:27:17,840
Perhaps the late Emperor and I were not made for each other.

1246
01:27:18,919-->01:27:21,439
It was my destiny to be selected at audition

1247
01:27:21,520-->01:27:24,39
and meet the late Emperor in the garden.

1248
01:27:24,600-->01:27:28,720
It was also my destiny to meet Consort Hua and Empress Wenyu in my life.

1249
01:27:29,360-->01:27:31,479
But what is the true destiny of a person?

1250
01:27:31,560-->01:27:35,120
No one may know until the end of one's life.

1251
01:27:35,199-->01:27:37,79
Then how should we live our life?
