1
00:02:15,279-->00:02:19,0
It was here that Mei was pushed and fell into the water.

2
00:02:19,600-->00:02:23,160
I believed that by remaining in His Majesty’s favor

3
00:02:23,239-->00:02:25,319
and having true friends by my side,

4
00:02:25,399-->00:02:30,520
I could live out an imperial life as Lady Wan free from worries.

5
00:02:31,919-->00:02:34,960
I was wrong and overly naive.

6
00:02:35,199-->00:02:37,519
I hardly realized that the state and the harem

7
00:02:37,599-->00:02:39,439
were driven by the same forces.

8
00:02:39,520-->00:02:45,480
It is a ruthless world filled with bloody contests.

9
00:02:45,559-->00:02:49,639
The concubines of the harem vied for His Majesty’s favor by every means.

10
00:02:49,719-->00:02:52,919
Mei was entrapped by the others and nearly died.

11
00:02:53,0-->00:02:56,840
It was a walk across thin ice. Many times I barely escaped the clutches of peril.

12
00:02:58,0-->00:03:01,639
It was impossible for me to stay above the fray.

13
00:03:01,719-->00:03:05,960
Before I realized it, I’d already been drawn into the strife.

14
00:03:09,439-->00:03:12,280
Now the Imperial Household Department always gives us the finest goods.

15
00:03:12,919-->00:03:15,840
They also allow Doctor Wen to send his medicinal tonic every day.

16
00:03:15,919-->00:03:18,759
Do you think it is good? The medicine tasted very bitter.

17
00:03:21,159-->00:03:24,520
There’s something else, Yu has really gone too far.

18
00:03:24,599-->00:03:27,879
It is said she curses you constantly since moving out of Zhongcui Palace.

19
00:03:29,0-->00:03:30,599
Let her.

20
00:03:30,680-->00:03:32,360
My conscience is clear.

21
00:03:32,999-->00:03:34,600
We’ll forgive her when it’s right.

22
00:03:34,680-->00:03:36,479
She has lost much. Her anger is natural.

23
00:03:37,80-->00:03:38,880
With time, she will calm.

24
00:03:39,560-->00:03:41,560
Young mistress, you are very kind.

25
00:03:42,960-->00:03:44,839
Young mistress, your tonic is ready.

26
00:03:52,840-->00:03:54,599
Recently, the tonic tastes quite sour.

27
00:03:55,479-->00:03:57,759
Perhaps it’s a new prescription from Doctor Wen.

28
00:04:01,680-->00:04:04,639
I’ve only been up a short while, yet now I grow weary again.

29
00:04:05,240-->00:04:08,960
Lately you’re always getting drowsy soon after rising.

30
00:04:10,199-->00:04:11,800
Help me inside for some sleep.

31
00:04:17,639-->00:04:18,639
Huanbi.

32
00:04:20,79-->00:04:21,959
When did I become so lethargic?

33
00:04:23,439-->00:04:25,839
For three or five days, you’ve been continually tired.

34
00:04:25,920-->00:04:28,880
Of the day’s 24 hours, you’ve spent 10 to 12 asleep.

35
00:04:28,959-->00:04:32,119
Two days ago, it was late morning when His Majesty visited.

36
00:04:32,720-->00:04:34,519
And you were still asleep in bed.

37
00:04:35,639-->00:04:37,759
Do you also sense that something is amiss?

38
00:04:37,839-->00:04:40,399
Young mistress, please stay awake. I’ll ask Doctor Wen to come.

39
00:04:42,440-->00:04:44,480
This acupuncture point is called the Hegu point.

40
00:04:44,559-->00:04:46,759
If your somnolence is an ordinary symptom,

41
00:04:47,360-->00:04:49,279
then acupuncture at this point will help.

42
00:04:49,359-->00:04:52,399
If it was caused by a drug, the color of the needle may change.

43
00:04:58,399-->00:05:01,79
As I expected, someone has tampered with my medicine.

44
00:05:03,519-->00:05:07,399
Please look, young mistress. The needle tip has turned light green.

45
00:05:08,399-->00:05:10,600
What is it? Poison?

46
00:05:10,679-->00:05:12,0
No, it isn’t.

47
00:05:12,639-->00:05:16,199
Someone has changed the dosage of my prescription.

48
00:05:16,279-->00:05:19,279
It was done carefully, by adding a very small amount.

49
00:05:19,359-->00:05:22,879
Even though I check on you daily, it is hard to detect.

50
00:05:23,600-->00:05:27,920
But if you take this medicine over a long period of time,

51
00:05:28,0-->00:05:31,479
you will experience fatigue and lethargy at first.

52
00:05:31,559-->00:05:35,240
Within six months, you will grow deranged, finally ending in complete delirium.

53
00:05:35,839-->00:05:38,399
The perpetrator must hold me in high regard

54
00:05:38,480-->00:05:41,120
to attempt to remove me in such an ingenious fashion.

55
00:05:41,199-->00:05:42,560
It’s fortunate we discovered it.

56
00:05:43,319-->00:05:46,360
Young mistress, you will recover with treatment.

57
00:05:47,119-->00:05:48,639
All medicine is dispensed by your prescription

58
00:05:48,720-->00:05:49,959
and prepared in my palace.

59
00:05:50,560-->00:05:56,40
It seems the new maids and eunuchs are highly suspect. We must take caution.

60
00:05:56,640-->00:05:58,839
Young mistress, what is your plan?

61
00:06:02,680-->00:06:03,959
I’ve made inquiries.

62
00:06:04,40-->00:06:05,920
Huasui was formerly Attendant Yu’s servant.

63
00:06:05,999-->00:06:09,79
After her demotion, several of her maids were sent away.

64
00:06:09,160-->00:06:12,119
Huasui was among them. She was then reassigned as your servant.

65
00:06:13,79-->00:06:15,600
I’m sure the wench planned to take revenge for Yu.

66
00:06:17,79-->00:06:19,639
What loyalty.

67
00:06:19,720-->00:06:22,480
Please spare me!

68
00:06:23,720-->00:06:25,519
Tell the truth.

69
00:06:25,600-->00:06:27,759
If you dare lie or conceal the truth,

70
00:06:27,839-->00:06:30,79
you’ll be dragged away and beaten to death.

71
00:06:30,160-->00:06:32,920
After becoming your servant,

72
00:06:32,999-->00:06:36,40
Yu summoned me to her residence one day.

73
00:06:36,120-->00:06:38,200
She gave me a great sum as reward.

74
00:06:38,799-->00:06:42,920
Miss Yu said I wouldn’t have to worry about anything.

75
00:06:43,0-->00:06:45,759
My only mission was to put something in your tonic and your meals.

76
00:06:47,360-->00:06:51,200
I dug a hole at the corner of the wall upon her instruction.

77
00:06:51,279-->00:06:54,560
When Miss Yu needs to pass along a message or a drug,

78
00:06:55,279-->00:06:59,720
someone places a note in that hole, and I go there to retrieve it.

79
00:06:59,800-->00:07:01,479
When is the note placed there?

80
00:07:02,360-->00:07:06,999
Miss Yu has someone place the drug in that hole every other day.

81
00:07:07,79-->00:07:09,239
Then I must go and retrieve it.

82
00:07:09,319-->00:07:10,959
Every other day.

83
00:07:11,679-->00:07:13,480
Then it’s tonight.

84
00:07:14,240-->00:07:17,119
When do you retrieve the drug? Is there a password?

85
00:07:17,199-->00:07:22,720
Between the seventh and the ninth hour, birdcall signals are heard from outside.

86
00:07:22,799-->00:07:25,0
Then I must make the same signals in response.

87
00:07:26,279-->00:07:27,880
Xiao Yunzi.

88
00:07:28,480-->00:07:31,959
Tie her up in the warehouse. Don’t let her take her own life.

89
00:07:32,40-->00:07:33,320
Yes, mistress.

90
00:07:33,399-->00:07:34,639
Let’s go.

91
00:07:38,959-->00:07:42,759
I must tell Mei about what has happened.

92
00:07:42,839-->00:07:45,279
Yes, we must let Lady Shen know

93
00:07:45,360-->00:07:47,479
so you may formulate a response together.

94
00:07:47,559-->00:07:50,279
- And Second Attendant An? - Lingrong is timid.

95
00:07:50,879-->00:07:53,0
We will not tell her. She would become frightened.

96
00:08:24,839-->00:08:26,120
Catch him.

97
00:08:26,199-->00:08:29,480
Xiao Yunzi, we have him. Hurry, go outside now!

98
00:08:29,559-->00:08:31,559
Come on. Let’s catch him.

99
00:08:36,200-->00:08:38,600
- Let me go. - Don’t resist!

100
00:08:39,399-->00:08:41,159
- Please let me go. - Kneel!

101
00:08:41,239-->00:08:42,559
Young mistress, please.

102
00:08:42,639-->00:08:45,360
Lift his head. I’m afraid he is not a stranger.

103
00:08:47,239-->00:08:49,39
Xiao Yinzi?

104
00:08:49,759-->00:08:51,640
Eunuch Yin, are you well?

105
00:08:52,520-->00:08:54,119
Lady Wan, I greet you.

106
00:08:54,200-->00:08:58,79
Though we have not met for some time, we once were master and servant.

107
00:08:58,159-->00:08:59,879
Just answer my questions.

108
00:09:01,479-->00:09:05,520
Why were you sneaking around the palace after dark?

109
00:09:06,120-->00:09:07,559
I–

110
00:09:09,639-->00:09:11,159
- Xiao Yunzi. - Yes, mistress.

111
00:09:11,239-->00:09:13,679
Strike this ungrateful traitor for me.

112
00:09:14,719-->00:09:17,120
- Beat him until he speaks. - Yes, mistress.

113
00:09:17,799-->00:09:20,520
Lady, please spare me!

114
00:09:23,719-->00:09:24,839
Spare me!

115
00:09:24,919-->00:09:27,760
- My lady. - Why have you come in such haste?

116
00:09:27,840-->00:09:29,760
Xiao Yinzi did not return to Yu’s residence.

117
00:09:29,840-->00:09:32,880
This morning, I was told he entered but did not leave Suiyu Pavilion.

118
00:09:33,919-->00:09:35,119
The wretch.

119
00:09:35,200-->00:09:39,759
My lady, eunuchs are weak. I’m certain he will confess under torture.

120
00:09:40,400-->00:09:44,200
Yu is surely done for. My lady, will she betray you?

121
00:09:44,279-->00:09:47,120
- What do you advise? - You must eliminate that possibility.

122
00:09:47,200-->00:09:48,479
No.

123
00:09:48,559-->00:09:51,120
My lady, if you take action now, you’ll draw attention to yourself.

124
00:09:52,0-->00:09:54,520
Why not let Yu take the blame?

125
00:09:56,320-->00:09:58,399
She planned to kill Zhen Huan to avenge her own loss.

126
00:09:58,999-->00:10:02,440
If given a chance to live, how could she not betray us?

127
00:10:02,519-->00:10:06,799
Of course she wants to live. But she won’t want her family harmed.

128
00:10:09,720-->00:10:11,679
Huan, really.

129
00:10:11,759-->00:10:14,39
What an awful thing. Why did you hide it from me?

130
00:10:14,119-->00:10:18,80
It was the Empress who told me just now that Yu was plotting to kill you.

131
00:10:18,159-->00:10:20,80
I didn’t mean to hide it from you.

132
00:10:20,760-->00:10:23,39
These matters are unsettling and frightful.

133
00:10:23,120-->00:10:24,759
It’s better to know nothing of it.

134
00:10:24,839-->00:10:27,559
I’ve always regarded you as my own sister.

135
00:10:27,639-->00:10:30,559
How could something befall my sister without me knowing about it?

136
00:10:30,640-->00:10:32,720
Fortunately, it’s over now.

137
00:10:33,760-->00:10:35,880
She is to take her own life by His Majesty’s decree.

138
00:10:36,600-->00:10:39,80
But I am not at all content.

139
00:10:39,160-->00:10:40,600
Nor am I.

140
00:10:40,679-->00:10:43,639
No one takes heart at the death of another.

141
00:10:43,720-->00:10:47,840
Besides, we have only stopped one plot. There’s no telling how many are to come.

142
00:10:47,919-->00:10:49,519
Let’s deal with them one by one.

143
00:10:49,599-->00:10:52,520
As long as we remain united, no one may trap us by guile.

144
00:10:53,919-->00:10:58,200
Lingrong is ever mild and gentle, but she is also quite sure of herself.

145
00:10:58,279-->00:10:59,559
Young mistress.

146
00:11:02,480-->00:11:05,520
Yu refuses to die and has gone into a rage at the Cold Palace.

147
00:11:05,600-->00:11:08,120
She demands to meet His Majesty one last time before she dies.

148
00:11:08,200-->00:11:09,279
Did you report to the Empress?

149
00:11:09,360-->00:11:13,239
She is suffering from severe headaches and cannot even leave her bed.

150
00:11:13,320-->00:11:15,440
She is unable to address this.

151
00:11:16,440-->00:11:18,440
Then only Consort Hua is qualified to do so.

152
00:11:18,519-->00:11:20,520
Consort Hua has taken no action whatsoever.

153
00:11:20,600-->00:11:23,39
They say she is indisposed.

154
00:11:23,120-->00:11:24,720
She has always been close to Yu.

155
00:11:24,799-->00:11:28,239
But now, she will take great pains to distance herself.

156
00:11:28,919-->00:11:31,720
Yu claims she was framed.

157
00:11:31,799-->00:11:33,960
Like a madwoman, she shattered the vessel of poison wine.

158
00:11:34,39-->00:11:37,440
She also cursed the young mistress in a venomous tone. It’s an outrage.

159
00:11:38,519-->00:11:41,480
Leave her be. It is merely her last-ditch struggle.

160
00:11:42,960-->00:11:45,120
Mei and Huan, the hour is late.

161
00:11:46,80-->00:11:47,759
I must return.

162
00:11:48,760-->00:11:51,679
- Please take care. - Lingrong, farewell.

163
00:11:52,759-->00:11:56,399
Let go of me! Keep your hands off!

164
00:12:02,679-->00:12:04,879
Second Attendant An, why have you come here?

165
00:12:04,959-->00:12:08,519
Zhen has heard that Yu is cursing her. She asked me to look into it.

166
00:12:08,600-->00:12:10,480
Yu is decreed to take her own life.

167
00:12:10,559-->00:12:13,599
But the madwoman ruined the poison wine and tore up the silk noose.

168
00:12:13,679-->00:12:15,799
I am truly at a loss.

169
00:12:15,880-->00:12:19,519
You’ve served His Majesty with distinction and have long experience in the palace.

170
00:12:20,80-->00:12:22,479
You certainly should be able to discern His Majesty’s intentions.

171
00:12:22,999-->00:12:26,279
- Young mistress, do you mean– - She is decreed to take her own life.

172
00:12:26,360-->00:12:29,359
So long as she lives no more, your duty has been fulfilled.

173
00:12:30,79-->00:12:32,880
Who will care if it was accomplished one way or another?

174
00:12:33,479-->00:12:34,759
I understand.

175
00:12:34,840-->00:12:36,759
Your servant will see you out.

176
00:12:36,840-->00:12:40,840
Your Majesty, please help me!

177
00:12:41,720-->00:12:43,679
Your Majesty!

178
00:12:45,440-->00:12:49,399
Zhen Huan, fate will bring you to a miserable end!

179
00:12:49,480-->00:12:51,679
I must let Zhen know

180
00:12:51,759-->00:12:54,119
that I did it for her own good.

181
00:12:54,880-->00:12:57,400
Lady Wan and Lady Shen, may good fortune be with you.

182
00:12:58,200-->00:13:00,559
I’m here to inform you that Yu has passed away.

183
00:13:03,240-->00:13:04,440
Then it’s settled.

184
00:13:05,240-->00:13:07,679
All it requires is a length of bowstring and it’s neatly done.

185
00:13:07,759-->00:13:09,360
You may rest easy now.

186
00:13:09,440-->00:13:11,559
- Rest easy? - Yes, young mistress.

187
00:13:11,639-->00:13:13,799
Weren’t you the one who sent Attendant An?

188
00:13:15,39-->00:13:16,840
Yu was in a furor.

189
00:13:16,920-->00:13:20,639
It was Attendant An’s idea to have me strangle her and get the job done.

190
00:13:22,0-->00:13:24,320
- She was strangled? - Yes, young mistress.

191
00:13:24,399-->00:13:26,320
It was Attendant An’s idea?

192
00:13:26,399-->00:13:30,120
Yes, mistress. Even my master hadn’t thought of that.

193
00:13:30,200-->00:13:32,799
So many dislike Yu that no one will say a word.

194
00:13:36,359-->00:13:39,80
- Well done. You may leave. - Yes, mistress.

195
00:13:40,960-->00:13:42,760
- Young mistress. - Are you all right?

196
00:13:42,840-->00:13:44,159
Young mistress, are you well?

197
00:13:44,240-->00:13:46,639
She has already died. Why tell us such an awful thing?

198
00:13:46,720-->00:13:50,200
Young mistress, the scent of this incense will make you feel better.

199
00:13:51,840-->00:13:54,839
- I bow before Attendant An. - Where’s Huan?

200
00:13:54,919-->00:13:58,720
She’s having tea with Lady Shen. I’ll inform her you’ve arrived.

201
00:13:58,799-->00:14:00,399
That’s not necessary.

202
00:14:00,480-->00:14:02,759
It just so happens that I’d like some tea myself.

203
00:14:02,840-->00:14:04,440
I’ll see myself in.

204
00:14:05,520-->00:14:10,159
I never imagined that Lingrong could be so ruthless.

205
00:14:10,960-->00:14:12,799
She did it for our own good.

206
00:14:14,279-->00:14:18,320
But it all began with you. Lingrong was never involved.

207
00:14:19,120-->00:14:23,799
Even so, she went to the Cold Palace and had Yu strangled.

208
00:14:23,879-->00:14:28,520
It’s completely unlike the delicate and gentle manner she’s always had.

209
00:14:29,159-->00:14:31,159
A baited cat grows as fierce as a lion.

210
00:14:31,240-->00:14:33,999
Not even Su Peisheng knew how to handle the situation,

211
00:14:34,80-->00:14:36,120
but Lingrong was able to settle it tidily.

212
00:14:37,39-->00:14:39,479
It’s truly surprising.

213
00:14:39,559-->00:14:42,639
It’s very different from the Lingrong I spend so much time with.

214
00:14:54,479-->00:14:56,960
Young mistress, why don’t you sleep?

215
00:14:57,840-->00:14:59,440
I’m a bit frightened.

216
00:15:00,360-->00:15:02,39
Yu has passed away,

217
00:15:02,759-->00:15:06,320
but it hasn’t brought this matter to an end.

218
00:15:06,919-->00:15:11,80
Young mistress, you suspect that Yu was guided by someone else?

219
00:15:11,679-->00:15:15,440
You should have kept her alive to interrogate her fully.

220
00:15:16,360-->00:15:19,640
She hated me to the core. She would never reveal her master.

221
00:15:20,600-->00:15:22,880
She might even accuse us of framing another in return.

222
00:15:24,360-->00:15:25,960
But instead she has died.

223
00:15:26,39-->00:15:29,840
The true culprit may be overly relieved, allowing us to trace the truth.

224
00:15:32,599-->00:15:37,360
Then we should make use of Yu’s death.

225
00:15:48,399-->00:15:50,240
A ghost!

226
00:15:51,80-->00:15:52,80
A ghost!

227
00:15:52,600-->00:15:58,279
You’ve all let your imaginations run wild talking of this ghost nonsense.

228
00:15:58,720-->00:16:00,639
I don’t believe in such things.

229
00:16:00,720-->00:16:04,560
Those who were hated by Yu in life would be haunted by her after death.

230
00:16:04,639-->00:16:05,640
LADY XIN

231
00:16:05,719-->00:16:08,760
- This does not concern us. - My lady, your words ring true.

232
00:16:08,839-->00:16:10,840
There was no other behind Yu’s crime.

233
00:16:10,919-->00:16:13,879
Of course she must reap what she has sown.

234
00:16:13,960-->00:16:15,839
If she had been guided by another,

235
00:16:15,920-->00:16:18,759
she certainly would haunt the one responsible for her death

236
00:16:18,840-->00:16:21,720
asking why she’d been used as a mere instrument of another’s will.

237
00:16:38,320-->00:16:40,959
- What’s that? - What is it?

238
00:16:49,279-->00:16:51,79
- That sounds like Concubine Li. - It does.

239
00:16:51,160-->00:16:54,120
- Jinxi, inform the Empress quickly. - Yes, mistress.

240
00:16:54,199-->00:16:55,959
Let’s go take a look.

241
00:17:00,440-->00:17:01,440
A ghost!

242
00:17:01,519-->00:17:03,840
It’s late at night. Why are you screaming?

243
00:17:03,919-->00:17:07,400
- Be quiet now! - A ghost! A ghost!

244
00:17:07,479-->00:17:10,959
It’s her. Is she coming for us? Is she here now?

245
00:17:11,40-->00:17:13,880
The next one to speak such nonsense goes directly to the Cold Palace!

246
00:17:14,959-->00:17:17,759
Don’t just stand there. Help her up.

247
00:17:21,759-->00:17:23,640
It wasn’t me!

248
00:17:23,719-->00:17:25,920
I only prepared the medicine!

249
00:17:26,0-->00:17:29,79
But I didn’t tell her to harm Lady Wan! It wasn’t me!

250
00:17:29,160-->00:17:32,599
She’s lost her mind. Cover her mouth and take her to Yikun Palace.

251
00:17:32,680-->00:17:34,160
One moment.

252
00:17:35,80-->00:17:36,680
My lady, please reconsider.

253
00:17:36,759-->00:17:41,319
This happened so suddenly. We should report to the Empress first.

254
00:17:41,920-->00:17:43,599
Do as you see fit.

255
00:17:43,680-->00:17:46,760
Concubine Li is in a bad state. I fear her words will offend the Empress.

256
00:17:46,839-->00:17:49,279
There will be time to inform her later.

257
00:17:49,999-->00:17:52,799
I assist the Empress in managing the harem.

258
00:17:52,880-->00:17:55,160
Do you think I’m unable to resolve such trifles?

259
00:17:55,239-->00:17:58,920
What Concubine Li said concerns the poisoning.

260
00:17:59,0-->00:18:01,799
I was directly affected. I have no choice but to intervene.

261
00:18:01,880-->00:18:05,839
You two hindered me like that. Are you opposing me intentionally?

262
00:18:05,919-->00:18:07,520
Take her away.

263
00:18:08,400-->00:18:10,599
Her Highness the Empress!

264
00:18:12,480-->00:18:14,759
Your Highness, may blessings and peace be with you.

265
00:18:21,160-->00:18:23,160
Your Highness, may good fortune be with you.

266
00:18:26,319-->00:18:28,39
You may rise.

267
00:18:28,119-->00:18:30,119
Thank you, Your Highness.

268
00:18:34,200-->00:18:36,599
You’ve made such a commotion here.

269
00:18:36,680-->00:18:38,719
When will I have peace?

270
00:18:39,519-->00:18:40,959
What happened to Concubine Li?

271
00:18:44,759-->00:18:47,959
Zhou Ninghai, you’re a mere servant. How dare you cover Concubine Li’s mouth!

272
00:18:48,559-->00:18:50,199
This is an outrage!

273
00:18:50,280-->00:18:53,519
Your Highness, Concubine Li lost her mind and was spouting nonsense.

274
00:18:53,599-->00:18:57,279
I asked him to cover her mouth, lest her foul words disturb the others.

275
00:18:57,359-->00:18:59,359
You must let her go.

276
00:18:59,439-->00:19:03,200
Or did you intend to take her all the way to Qixiang Palace with her mouth covered?

277
00:19:09,39-->00:19:11,440
My lady, save me! Yu is here!

278
00:19:11,520-->00:19:14,359
I didn’t order her to do it! It wasn’t me!

279
00:19:14,439-->00:19:15,880
Let go!

280
00:19:15,960-->00:19:18,959
You’re right. No others were involved. She herself faced the consequences.

281
00:19:19,40-->00:19:22,359
Fear not. Yu is not here. Return to the palace with me.

282
00:19:25,559-->00:19:29,320
Yu is coming! She’s here! She’s coming for revenge!

283
00:19:29,400-->00:19:30,760
What is this?

284
00:19:31,359-->00:19:35,160
Your Highness, please help me! It’s a ghost!

285
00:19:35,240-->00:19:39,39
Lunacy! Have you lost your senses? I can’t allow you to go around like this.

286
00:19:39,119-->00:19:41,479
Jiang Fuhai. Take Concubine Li to Jingren Palace.

287
00:19:41,559-->00:19:43,160
Your Highness.

288
00:19:45,960-->00:19:48,680
Concubine Li has surely lost her mind.

289
00:19:48,759-->00:19:51,160
Will she not disturb you at peaceful Jingren Palace?

290
00:19:51,839-->00:19:55,160
I should take her and care for her.

291
00:19:55,239-->00:19:58,519
Jingren Palace is quite spacious. We can certainly find room for her.

292
00:19:58,960-->00:20:00,960
Though Concubine Li is delirious,

293
00:20:02,39-->00:20:05,960
her words concern Yu’s poisoning.

294
00:20:06,39-->00:20:09,600
It is of great importance. I must look into this.

295
00:20:09,680-->00:20:13,960
Is it inappropriate to let Concubine Li stay with me?

296
00:20:14,640-->00:20:16,719
Your Highness, we bid you good night.

297
00:20:17,480-->00:20:19,679
We bid you good night, Your Highness.

298
00:20:19,760-->00:20:22,839
- Jiang Fuhai, bring Concubine Li along. - Yes, Your Highness.

299
00:20:32,119-->00:20:34,560
Your Highness, may blessings and peace be with you.

300
00:20:34,640-->00:20:36,959
You may rise. Please take your seats.

301
00:20:37,559-->00:20:39,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

302
00:20:43,599-->00:20:48,320
I’ve summoned you so early because I want to know about last night.

303
00:20:50,199-->00:20:52,479
Her Highness the Empress Dowager!

304
00:20:57,319-->00:21:00,319
We greet the Empress Dowager. May blessings and peace be with you.

305
00:21:01,39-->00:21:04,240
- You may rise. - Thank you, Your Highness.

306
00:21:04,839-->00:21:08,359
Consort Hua visited me earlier and said that Concubine Li was not well.

307
00:21:08,440-->00:21:10,39
So I’ve come to look into it.

308
00:21:12,279-->00:21:16,119
Concubine Li is useless. She couldn’t even take a fright.

309
00:21:16,880-->00:21:20,519
The saying is indeed true, “A guilty conscience needs no accuser.”

310
00:21:21,640-->00:21:23,880
But Concubine Li said that Consort Hua guided her.

311
00:21:23,960-->00:21:28,160
What of it? Concubine Li’s words can only be regarded as madness.

312
00:21:28,800-->00:21:29,799
Your Highness–

313
00:21:29,880-->00:21:33,239
I know that you have been restrained by Consort Hua for many years.

314
00:21:34,999-->00:21:39,160
She appears not to know her limits. But the Emperor is fond of her.

315
00:21:39,759-->00:21:41,960
And her brother is Nian Gengyao.

316
00:21:42,999-->00:21:44,799
Now Concubine Li has lost her mind.

317
00:21:44,880-->00:21:48,39
No one will believe the words of a madwoman.

318
00:21:48,119-->00:21:50,719
Send her away from Jingren Palace to the Cold Palace,

319
00:21:50,800-->00:21:53,79
lest she defile your residence.

320
00:21:53,160-->00:21:54,160
Yes, Your Highness.

321
00:21:54,239-->00:21:58,79
Tell the others that rumors were running throughout the palace.

322
00:21:58,160-->00:22:00,880
The Empress herself had to intervene.

323
00:22:01,799-->00:22:05,39
It was you who calmed the harem and dispelled the rumors.

324
00:22:06,280-->00:22:10,79
As for Lady Wan, she is quite clever.

325
00:22:10,680-->00:22:12,920
And Lady Shen shows self-possession.

326
00:22:12,999-->00:22:16,760
You may let Lady Shen try managing things in the harem.

327
00:22:17,720-->00:22:18,959
I will.

328
00:22:19,40-->00:22:22,640
It was His Majesty and Your Highness who selected those two at the audition.

329
00:22:23,920-->00:22:28,160
Then deliver my decree that Consort Hua must take a rest.

330
00:22:28,239-->00:22:31,839
Her assistance in affairs of the harem is no longer required.

331
00:22:33,959-->00:22:35,440
Yes, Your Highness.

332
00:22:38,880-->00:22:40,0
I greet Consort Hua.

333
00:22:45,560-->00:22:48,920
This is a scorching summer. It is no surprise that tempers are short.

334
00:22:48,999-->00:22:52,200
I know not what I have done wrong. Please tell me directly, my lady.

335
00:22:52,279-->00:22:54,239
I’ll accept your punishment accordingly.

336
00:22:55,160-->00:22:57,199
I followed your advice.

337
00:22:57,279-->00:23:00,119
I quickly informed the Empress Dowager of Concubine Li’s madness

338
00:23:00,200-->00:23:02,200
in order to distance myself from those events.

339
00:23:02,280-->00:23:04,960
I don’t care that Concubine Li was sent to the Cold Palace.

340
00:23:05,39-->00:23:07,999
But I’ve lost the power to assist in the affairs of the harem.

341
00:23:08,79-->00:23:11,640
All thanks to your brilliant idea, isn’t that so?

342
00:23:13,759-->00:23:16,319
Congratulations, my lady.

343
00:23:17,759-->00:23:21,359
To what do I owe the pleasure of your congratulation?

344
00:23:22,79-->00:23:25,239
Anything Concubine Li says will be seen as the ravings of a madwoman.

345
00:23:25,320-->00:23:26,920
Even if the Empress Dowager and His Majesty

346
00:23:26,999-->00:23:28,359
grow suspicious, there is no evidence.

347
00:23:28,960-->00:23:31,880
You have lost some power for now, but kept yourself from harm.

348
00:23:32,759-->00:23:36,200
Besides, His Majesty is affectionate.

349
00:23:36,280-->00:23:38,880
Your fortune may rise or fall on His Majesty’s whim.

350
00:23:38,960-->00:23:41,359
You make it sound easy!

351
00:23:41,440-->00:23:44,39
His Majesty is fascinated with Lady Wan.

352
00:23:44,119-->00:23:45,880
And the Empress puts obstacles in my path.

353
00:23:46,760-->00:23:50,119
It takes great trouble to even meet with him once.

354
00:23:50,199-->00:23:52,240
My lady, you are most virtuous.

355
00:23:52,319-->00:23:55,480
I will gladly do my utmost to make peace between His Majesty and my lady.

356
00:23:55,559-->00:23:56,960
Are you capable of that?

357
00:23:57,560-->00:23:59,640
Your Majesty, may blessings be with you.

358
00:23:59,720-->00:24:01,559
Your Highness, may blessings be with you.

359
00:24:02,160-->00:24:04,479
The sun shines fiercely at this hour.

360
00:24:04,560-->00:24:07,839
Why are you walking about with the Princess?

361
00:24:07,920-->00:24:09,719
Come, let me hold her.

362
00:24:15,920-->00:24:18,840
I haven’t seen her for a few days. It seems she has lost some weight.

363
00:24:18,920-->00:24:20,440
She has lost her appetite in the hot weather,

364
00:24:20,519-->00:24:22,200
so she has lost some weight.

365
00:24:22,279-->00:24:24,119
It has been quite hot.

366
00:24:24,199-->00:24:26,479
Why don’t we go to Yuanming Palace to escape the heat?

367
00:24:26,559-->00:24:29,799
Yuanming Palace is ready. Your Majesty may depart at any time.

368
00:24:30,599-->00:24:32,239
Consort Duan is in poor health.

369
00:24:32,319-->00:24:34,839
The hot weather is not good for her recovery.

370
00:24:35,519-->00:24:37,440
- Let her come with us. - Of course.

371
00:24:38,240-->00:24:40,39
As for Consort Hua–

372
00:24:40,640-->00:24:44,759
Why don’t we let her stay here to care of the rest of the concubines?

373
00:24:44,840-->00:24:46,199
That ornament–

374
00:24:47,39-->00:24:49,359
It was a gift I granted to Consort Hua.

375
00:24:50,240-->00:24:51,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

376
00:24:51,520-->00:24:54,559
Every time Consort Hua wears it, the Princess smiles.

377
00:24:55,160-->00:24:59,160
So Consort Hua gave it to me to entertain the Princess.

378
00:25:01,799-->00:25:02,880
Let her come as well.

379
00:25:03,999-->00:25:05,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

380
00:25:09,359-->00:25:12,839
It is said that His Majesty prefers Yuanming Palace. This is my first visit.

381
00:25:12,920-->00:25:15,359
Young mistress, I have heard that Consort Duan is here as well.

382
00:25:15,440-->00:25:17,800
We have yet to meet her.

383
00:25:17,880-->00:25:21,759
She has been ill for many years. Someday we will surely meet her.

384
00:25:23,799-->00:25:25,279
What is it?

385
00:25:29,279-->00:25:31,160
Remarkable archery.

386
00:25:31,240-->00:25:34,880
It is a wild pigeon, known for its dexterity and nimbleness.

387
00:25:34,960-->00:25:38,359
It was struck by a single arrow. The hunter displays remarkable skill.

388
00:25:39,519-->00:25:41,159
I greet Lady Wan.

389
00:25:41,240-->00:25:42,799
Is His Majesty practicing mounted archery?

390
00:25:42,880-->00:25:46,400
Marquess Guo is here. His Majesty and the Marquess are hunting together.

391
00:25:46,480-->00:25:47,800
The Marquess is quite skilled as an archer.

392
00:25:47,880-->00:25:49,880
Even His Majesty praises him for it.

393
00:25:49,960-->00:25:52,479
Marquess Guo is versed in music, chess, poetry and painting.

394
00:25:52,559-->00:25:54,239
I did not know he excelled at archery as well.

395
00:25:54,319-->00:25:58,119
You have not been here long enough to see, but the Marquess excels in many areas.

396
00:26:04,79-->00:26:06,119
This imperial doctor is–

397
00:26:06,200-->00:26:07,200
LIU BEN

398
00:26:07,279-->00:26:09,119
Doctor Jiang has returned home for mourning.

399
00:26:09,199-->00:26:12,560
I was sent by the Imperial Medical Bureau to check on Lady Shen.

400
00:26:12,640-->00:26:15,0
- Doctor Liu, please wait. - Yes, madam.

401
00:26:17,359-->00:26:20,39
From your accent, it seems that you’re from Jizhou.

402
00:26:20,880-->00:26:24,280
I was transferred from Jizhou and just arrived a few days ago.

403
00:26:24,359-->00:26:27,79
What a coincidence. I’m from Jizhou as well.

404
00:26:28,319-->00:26:30,760
It’s a great honor to meet a fellow countryman.

405
00:26:34,440-->00:26:37,440
Your Majesty and Lady Shen, my congratulations.

406
00:26:37,520-->00:26:41,760
You are with child. More than one month already.

407
00:26:42,920-->00:26:44,320
Good.

408
00:26:45,200-->00:26:47,720
- You may rise. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

409
00:26:48,599-->00:26:51,0
Where are Lady Shen’s closest maids?

410
00:26:52,640-->00:26:53,760
Here.

411
00:26:53,839-->00:26:56,640
You two are the personal servants of Lady Shen.

412
00:26:56,720-->00:26:59,799
She is with child and should be looked after with extra care.

413
00:26:59,880-->00:27:02,880
You must report to me on her condition daily.

414
00:27:02,959-->00:27:03,959
Yes, Your Highness.

415
00:27:04,40-->00:27:06,359
As usual, the Empress is meticulous in all matters.

416
00:27:06,439-->00:27:09,600
Your Majesty, now that Lady Shen is expecting.

417
00:27:09,680-->00:27:13,359
Shouldn’t we appoint a reliable doctor for her care?

418
00:27:13,440-->00:27:17,359
Your Majesty, the one who was sent to check on me is Liu Ben.

419
00:27:18,79-->00:27:20,80
I have high regard for him.

420
00:27:20,160-->00:27:23,920
He and I are from the same province. May he take charge of my care?

421
00:27:24,519-->00:27:26,200
That is good.

422
00:27:26,279-->00:27:28,640
Your health comes before all else.

423
00:27:28,719-->00:27:32,280
You must take care of yourself and ensure that there are no mishaps.

424
00:27:32,359-->00:27:33,559
Yes, Your Highness.

425
00:27:35,160-->00:27:37,520
JIUZHOU QINGYAN HALL (HALL OF THE NINE CONTINENTS IN PEACE)

426
00:27:37,599-->00:27:41,599
Lady Hui, that hairpin is quite delicate.

427
00:27:42,719-->00:27:44,720
It must be a new gift from the Empress Dowager.

428
00:27:44,799-->00:27:45,920
Yes, it is.

429
00:27:45,999-->00:27:49,960
Her Highness learned of Lady Hui’s pregnancy, so she had it sent here.

430
00:27:50,760-->00:27:53,200
The Gods of Harmony on the hairpin

431
00:27:53,279-->00:27:56,599
represent abundant fertility and good fortune.

432
00:27:57,160-->00:28:01,760
This shows that the Empress Dowager very much looks forward to the newborn.

433
00:28:07,920-->00:28:11,799
CONSORT DUAN

434
00:28:13,79-->00:28:17,0
Consort Duan!

435
00:28:23,960-->00:28:27,560
Your Majesty and Your Highness, may blessings and peace be with you.

436
00:28:28,280-->00:28:30,999
- You may rise. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

437
00:28:40,520-->00:28:43,319
Your Majesty, you are once again surrounded by new beauties.

438
00:28:43,960-->00:28:46,960
Consort Duan has not met any newcomers for quite some time.

439
00:28:47,39-->00:28:50,359
I see that her eye is just as keen as in the old days.

440
00:28:50,960-->00:28:53,960
The sun is shining fiercely, yet you still rushed here.

441
00:28:54,39-->00:28:57,680
It’s just a feast for a child’s birthday, not any urgent matter.

442
00:28:58,359-->00:29:00,40
Wenyi’s first birthday brings us great joy.

443
00:29:00,119-->00:29:02,439
I must pay my respects.

444
00:29:02,519-->00:29:04,920
Besides, much time has passed since I last saw the Princess.

445
00:29:05,760-->00:29:08,79
- Take your seat. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

446
00:29:09,160-->00:29:12,760
When last we met, Princess Wenyi was just one month old.

447
00:29:13,559-->00:29:15,640
Your Majesty, I must say,

448
00:29:16,199-->00:29:18,999
though the celebration is magnificent, it feels somewhat restrained.

449
00:29:19,880-->00:29:22,640
Since this is a family feast, and everyone here is family,

450
00:29:23,279-->00:29:26,240
may we not dispense with formality?

451
00:29:26,319-->00:29:28,119
If you have an idea, just tell us.

452
00:29:28,200-->00:29:32,119
Each of the concubines here possesses different and varied talents.

453
00:29:32,959-->00:29:35,839
Let us write down the skills of each and draw lots.

454
00:29:35,919-->00:29:39,80
Whatever is drawn will be performed to entertain the guests.

455
00:29:39,160-->00:29:41,119
Does it please Your Majesty?

456
00:29:41,200-->00:29:45,0
The idea is novel. We shall do as you say.

457
00:29:45,999-->00:29:47,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

458
00:29:57,319-->00:30:01,599
Your Highness, please show us your calligraphy, writing the word “longevity.”

459
00:30:02,640-->00:30:07,119
Seeing as today is the birthday of Princess Wenyi,

460
00:30:07,200-->00:30:10,160
I will write the word “longevity” as a gift to her.

461
00:30:11,200-->00:30:13,599
I express gratitude to Your Highness on behalf of Wenyi.

462
00:30:26,200-->00:30:28,400
LONGEVITY

463
00:30:28,960-->00:30:32,119
The Empress’s calligraphy grows continually better.

464
00:30:33,440-->00:30:34,640
So refined and exquisite.

465
00:30:37,520-->00:30:41,960
Your Majesty and Your Highness, please forgive me.

466
00:30:42,760-->00:30:47,680
I’m too weak to stay and enjoy the feast.

467
00:30:48,720-->00:30:52,279
You’re indisposed. You may retire for some rest.

468
00:30:52,359-->00:30:54,400
I will see you when time allows.

469
00:30:54,480-->00:30:56,79
Thank you, Your Majesty.

470
00:30:59,439-->00:31:01,719
My lady, I know that your health is poor,

471
00:31:01,799-->00:31:03,759
but you’re leaving so soon.

472
00:31:03,840-->00:31:05,839
I’m afraid His Majesty will be disappointed.

473
00:31:06,439-->00:31:11,279
If I stay, I’m afraid those who want to put on a show will be disappointed.

474
00:31:12,480-->00:31:15,200
I dislike such pretentious types.

475
00:31:15,279-->00:31:17,680
Let us put them out of sight and out of mind.

476
00:31:18,720-->00:31:20,440
This is for Lady Wan.

477
00:31:21,400-->00:31:23,400
Please dance “Flying Wild Goose.”

478
00:31:27,920-->00:31:31,480
The dance was created by Consort Mei of Emperor Xuanzong in the Tang Dynasty.

479
00:31:31,559-->00:31:35,399
It was believed lost for many years, but Empress Chunyuan loved dance.

480
00:31:36,160-->00:31:40,279
She attempted to find the original version and then spent great effort to amend it.

481
00:31:40,359-->00:31:42,560
Everyone was profoundly moved by her dancing.

482
00:31:43,160-->00:31:45,560
The whole palace was enchanted.

483
00:31:46,359-->00:31:49,679
Lady Wan is still young. How could she perform “Flying Wild Goose”?

484
00:31:52,599-->00:31:55,39
My dancing skills are truly unpresentable.

485
00:31:55,119-->00:31:57,760
I’m afraid I will expose myself to ridicule.

486
00:31:57,839-->00:32:01,440
If you are unable to dance, then no need to impose on yourself.

487
00:32:01,520-->00:32:06,440
Empress Chunyuan moved so gracefully. I doubt that anyone could ever compare.

488
00:32:08,119-->00:32:12,240
“Flying Wild Goose” is easy to learn but difficult to master. Let it be.

489
00:32:12,320-->00:32:14,239
She will perform something else.

490
00:32:14,839-->00:32:19,400
“Flying Wild Goose” has not been performed in the palace for a long time.

491
00:32:19,479-->00:32:21,880
Its long absence makes us wish to see it again.

492
00:32:21,959-->00:32:26,439
Lady Wan, you may dance in your own way.

493
00:32:28,559-->00:32:31,120
Please allow me to prepare. I’ll return presently.

494
00:32:45,319-->00:32:49,280
Your Majesty, the common musical accompaniment is vulgar.

495
00:32:49,359-->00:32:51,160
Please allow me to play the music.

496
00:32:51,239-->00:32:54,559
Attendant An will sing to accompany Lady Wan’s dancing.

497
00:32:56,359-->00:32:58,280
With pleasure.

498
00:33:00,0-->00:33:04,0
Bring out Consort Dowager Shu’s Zither of Endless Longing.

499
00:33:04,79-->00:33:06,239
The day Consort Shu entered the palace,

500
00:33:06,320-->00:33:09,120
the late Emperor granted her a zither named Endless Longing

501
00:33:09,999-->00:33:14,0
and a flute named Eternal Faithfulness as a token of his love.

502
00:33:14,79-->00:33:15,679
After the late Emperor died,

503
00:33:15,760-->00:33:18,280
Consort Shu left the palace for the temple.

504
00:33:18,960-->00:33:22,199
The zither and flute were left behind.

505
00:33:22,279-->00:33:24,800
Today we have the good fortune of hearing one of them.

506
00:33:44,919-->00:33:49,759
Dance lightly like a startled wild goose

507
00:33:50,600-->00:33:55,240
Move gracefully like a soaring dragon

508
00:33:56,359-->00:34:01,319
More glorious than the chrysanthemums of autumn

509
00:34:02,279-->00:34:06,400
More majestic than the pines of spring

510
00:34:08,80-->00:34:15,0
Just like the moon mantled in light clouds

511
00:34:19,800-->00:34:26,719
Swinging like a snowflake swirling in the blowing breeze

512
00:34:31,480-->00:34:34,320
Gazing from a distance

513
00:34:34,400-->00:34:40,160
As bright as the sun rising above the rosy clouds of dawn

514
00:34:40,239-->00:34:44,400
Her every movement corresponds to Empress Chunyuan’s.

515
00:34:45,760-->00:34:46,959
DUKE DUN

516
00:34:47,39-->00:34:51,40
It is beautiful, but lacking innovation.

517
00:34:51,640-->00:34:54,999
Innovation is good. But respect is much more important.

518
00:36:48,639-->00:36:52,400
How many more surprises can we expect from you?

519
00:36:54,280-->00:36:57,800
It is a mere performance. Your Majesty, please don’t laugh.

520
00:36:58,280-->00:37:00,639
You’ve danced for some time. Are you tired?

521
00:37:01,880-->00:37:03,479
I am not.

522
00:37:04,320-->00:37:08,199
I never saw Empress Chunyuan perform “Flying Wild Goose” with ingenious grace.

523
00:37:08,280-->00:37:10,560
It is truly my loss.

524
00:37:10,639-->00:37:14,519
What I performed today is an imitation of Consort Mei’s dance.

525
00:37:14,599-->00:37:19,119
My insignificant skill cannot compare to the performance of Empress Chunyuan.

526
00:37:26,800-->00:37:28,360
Yunli.

527
00:37:28,440-->00:37:32,679
The sound of Eternal Faithfulness must indeed accompany Endless Longing.

528
00:37:32,760-->00:37:35,479
Only together do they make truly unparalleled music.

529
00:37:37,559-->00:37:41,39
This is Noble Lady Wan from the Zhen family.

530
00:37:42,280-->00:37:45,440
This is Noble Lady Hui from the Shen family.

531
00:37:48,719-->00:37:50,679
The one who just sang–

532
00:37:51,559-->00:37:53,959
- I’m Second Attendant An. - Rewards.

533
00:37:56,439-->00:37:58,599
You, come be seated here.

534
00:37:59,840-->00:38:01,39
Thank you, Your Majesty.

535
00:38:08,760-->00:38:11,39
We bow in respect before Your Majesty.

536
00:38:12,159-->00:38:13,760
What a coincidence. You are all here.

537
00:38:15,440-->00:38:16,800
You may rise.

538
00:38:16,880-->00:38:18,160
Come here.

539
00:38:20,840-->00:38:23,520
How are you? How do you feel today?

540
00:38:24,239-->00:38:27,320
I am very well. Thank you, Your Majesty.

541
00:38:27,400-->00:38:29,320
Your Majesty, have you dined yet?

542
00:38:29,959-->00:38:34,239
I’ve just retained a new chef, a master in Jiangnan cuisine.

543
00:38:34,320-->00:38:37,959
I had dinner in Bitong Study Hall. Maybe another day.

544
00:38:38,679-->00:38:42,199
Your Majesty, the General of Yili sent us melons in tribute.

545
00:38:42,280-->00:38:43,919
Let’s try them together.

546
00:38:44,0-->00:38:47,39
- Good. I’ll sample them with you. - Yes, Your Majesty.

547
00:38:53,159-->00:38:54,359
Who is lurking there?

548
00:38:57,519-->00:38:59,0
I saw you! Come out now!

549
00:38:59,79-->00:39:02,120
Don’t catch me! I’m a servant of Lady Hui!

550
00:39:04,439-->00:39:08,840
It’s Fuling, one of Lady Hui’s servants. Why is she sneaking about?

551
00:39:08,920-->00:39:12,360
What is in your hands? What is it?

552
00:39:13,599-->00:39:14,880
What?

553
00:39:15,840-->00:39:18,79
You try to steal away with Lady Hui’s belongings?

554
00:39:18,160-->00:39:19,560
Young mistress, save me!

555
00:39:19,639-->00:39:22,159
How could you? I will not allow it.

556
00:39:27,239-->00:39:30,199
- What is this? - Blood.

557
00:39:31,199-->00:39:33,599
Why is there blood on the clothing?

558
00:39:33,679-->00:39:36,880
Is it possible that someone attempted to kill for money?

559
00:39:38,359-->00:39:40,360
Do these things belong to Lady Hui?

560
00:39:40,960-->00:39:43,719
Why are they stained with blood?

561
00:39:43,800-->00:39:47,199
Is it possible that Lady Hui had her menstruation?

562
00:39:50,440-->00:39:52,40
I didn’t.

563
00:39:52,639-->00:39:55,79
Your Majesty, this servant is acting so strangely.

564
00:39:55,160-->00:39:59,880
We should send her to the Office of Punishment for a full interrogation.

565
00:40:00,519-->00:40:04,280
I didn’t know you were a thief. Drag her out and beat her now.

566
00:40:04,360-->00:40:07,80
Young mistress, I was destroying the evidence for you.

567
00:40:08,159-->00:40:10,439
Yet you would ruthlessly allow me to die.

568
00:40:11,800-->00:40:15,119
Why should I remain loyal to you?

569
00:40:15,840-->00:40:19,360
Your Majesty, I dare not hide the truth from you now.

570
00:40:20,239-->00:40:24,159
In fact, our young mistress was never pregnant at all.

571
00:40:24,239-->00:40:27,79
Nor did I steal these clothes.

572
00:40:27,159-->00:40:30,920
They were stained two days ago when the young mistress had her menstruation.

573
00:40:30,999-->00:40:32,800
She asked me to get rid of them.

574
00:40:33,320-->00:40:35,559
These clothes are solid evidence.

575
00:40:35,640-->00:40:37,80
Mei.

576
00:40:41,679-->00:40:45,80
Your Majesty, this is slander.

577
00:40:46,840-->00:40:49,920
Lady Hui has had a shock. Summon the imperial doctor.

578
00:40:50,0-->00:40:52,0
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Eunuch Su.

579
00:40:52,719-->00:40:55,399
Please call Doctor Liu. He’s been caring for my pregnancy.

580
00:40:55,480-->00:40:59,79
I don’t know if he is on duty tonight.

581
00:40:59,159-->00:41:02,760
Young mistress, Doctor Liu is not on duty today.

582
00:41:02,840-->00:41:05,679
- No matter. - Yes, Your Majesty.

583
00:41:05,760-->00:41:08,480
Your Majesty, it’s Doctor Liu who’s been caring for my pregnancy.

584
00:41:08,559-->00:41:09,880
No matter!

585
00:41:25,840-->00:41:29,639
Your Majesty, the young mistress is not with child.

586
00:41:29,719-->00:41:32,920
Which imperial doctor diagnosed her?

587
00:41:35,760-->00:41:36,760
Your Majesty.

588
00:41:41,320-->00:41:43,320
- Su Peisheng. - Yes, Your Majesty.

589
00:41:44,360-->00:41:47,880
Summon Liu Ben at once.

590
00:41:48,599-->00:41:50,400
If he dares to resist, tie him up immediately.

591
00:41:51,320-->00:41:52,559
Your Majesty,

592
00:41:52,639-->00:41:54,840
when I summoned Doctor Jiang just now,

593
00:41:54,920-->00:41:57,39
I had Doctor Liu summoned as well.

594
00:41:58,0-->00:42:01,719
But Doctor Liu’s residence has already been vacated.

595
00:42:04,320-->00:42:06,640
A fine state of affairs this is.

596
00:42:07,760-->00:42:10,760
Lady Shen, is he not from the same province as you?

597
00:42:13,760-->00:42:18,39
It was you who requested that he care for you, wasn’t it?

598
00:42:18,920-->00:42:20,0
Your Majesty.

599
00:42:20,79-->00:42:23,320
Whoever dares intercede for Shen will receive the same punishment.

600
00:42:23,999-->00:42:25,599
Your Majesty.

601
00:42:27,199-->00:42:31,80
Your Majesty, Lady Wan and Lady Hui are quite close.

602
00:42:31,679-->00:42:32,999
I’m wondering if that–

603
00:42:33,79-->00:42:34,320
Silence!

604
00:42:37,519-->00:42:39,960
Your Majesty, please quiet your anger.

605
00:42:49,200-->00:42:51,400
You deceived the Empress Dowager as well as myself.

606
00:42:51,479-->00:42:53,559
How dare you flaunt her hairpin!

607
00:42:55,560-->00:42:58,239
Your Majesty, you must care for your health first.

608
00:43:06,959-->00:43:11,839
The Noble Lady from the Shen family has behaved imprudently.

609
00:43:12,760-->00:43:16,880
She is demoted to Second Attendant, deprived of the honorific name Hui

610
00:43:17,760-->00:43:19,519
and to be confined to Cunju Hall.

611
00:43:19,600-->00:43:22,119
No one is to visit her without our permission.

612
00:43:25,160-->00:43:29,119
Your Majesty, please instruct us how to deal with Liu Ben and Fuling–

613
00:43:29,199-->00:43:31,920
Track down Liu Ben, take him alive.

614
00:43:31,999-->00:43:35,519
And Fuling will be sentenced to death.

615
00:43:38,559-->00:43:39,760
Mei.

616
00:43:39,840-->00:43:42,600
What? Liu Ben escaped?

617
00:43:43,199-->00:43:46,239
My lady, please be calm. I’ve already sent someone to chase him.

618
00:43:46,320-->00:43:50,0
Liu Ben knew too much of our plan. He must not remain alive.

619
00:43:50,800-->00:43:52,80
He must be killed on sight.

620
00:43:52,760-->00:43:55,199
Catch him alive, or bring his dead body to me.

621
00:43:55,280-->00:43:59,40
I don’t believe a man can disappear completely.

622
00:43:59,119-->00:44:03,880
Liuzhu, tell Xiao Yunzi to find Doctor Wen Shichu.

623
00:44:03,960-->00:44:07,40
Ask him to convey a handwritten letter from myself to my family

624
00:44:07,119-->00:44:09,280
and another letter to Mei’s grandparents in the capital.

625
00:44:09,359-->00:44:11,280
Tell them that we must track down Liu Ben.

626
00:44:11,360-->00:44:12,960
I will surely do so.

627
00:44:22,280-->00:44:25,120
Young mistress, Fangruo has already done what you requested of her.

628
00:44:27,960-->00:44:31,199
Mistress Meizhuang asked Fangruo to pass this to you.

629
00:44:31,280-->00:44:33,439
It was only to be delivered into your hands.

630
00:44:36,0-->00:44:39,239
Take care of yourself and support Lingrong.

631
00:44:41,719-->00:44:43,559
Mei is trapped in such a difficult situation

632
00:44:43,640-->00:44:45,800
yet still shows consideration for me.

633
00:44:47,679-->00:44:49,679
Mistress Meizhuang is right.

634
00:44:49,760-->00:44:53,959
At the moment, Attendant An is the only one you can rely on.

635
00:45:05,479-->00:45:08,679
I hear that Princess Wenyi has been unwell and crying constantly.

636
00:45:10,39-->00:45:13,79
I’ll ask the priest to hold a prayer ceremony to bless her.

637
00:45:19,320-->00:45:20,919
Who is singing?

638
00:45:21,0-->00:45:23,80
Perhaps a female entertainer from the palace.

639
00:45:24,239-->00:45:27,479
Such a beautiful voice is rarely found.

640
00:45:27,560-->00:45:34,39
One must pick a flower at the prime of its bloom

641
00:45:34,719-->00:45:41,639
Do not wait until the blossoms fade and fall

642
00:45:45,400-->00:45:46,760
Huan.

643
00:45:46,840-->00:45:48,960
Who is singing there?

644
00:45:51,800-->00:45:54,39
- I greet Consort Hua. - I greet Consort Hua.

645
00:45:54,999-->00:45:57,280
- You may rise. - Thank you.

646
00:45:57,960-->00:46:00,280
When did Lady Wan find her voice?

647
00:46:00,920-->00:46:05,0
You are skilled in singing and dancing. This comes as quite a surprise.

648
00:46:05,519-->00:46:08,800
I’m not the one who should receive your praise. I could never sing like that.

649
00:46:08,880-->00:46:10,799
It was Second Attendant An.

650
00:46:12,679-->00:46:15,639
“One must pick a flower at the prime of its bloom.”

651
00:46:16,440-->00:46:19,280
Flowers are always used as a symbol for women.

652
00:46:19,360-->00:46:22,639
With her song, she aims to draw the attention of men.

653
00:46:22,719-->00:46:25,120
She’s willing to be “picked” at a moment’s notice.

654
00:46:25,840-->00:46:27,800
The title is “Golden Embroidered Garments.”

655
00:46:27,879-->00:46:29,800
It advises us to cherish what we have.

656
00:46:29,880-->00:46:31,559
Surely you have mistaken its meaning.

657
00:46:31,639-->00:46:33,960
Lady Wan indeed has a glib tongue.

658
00:46:34,39-->00:46:37,0
But only a dutiful woman will be regarded as virtuous,

659
00:46:37,80-->00:46:39,320
not one who defies with sophistry.

660
00:46:39,399-->00:46:42,800
Lady Wan disregards the rules of decorum and offends her superiors with her words.

661
00:46:44,0-->00:46:45,0
I dare not.

662
00:46:45,80-->00:46:48,880
Lady Wan intends no offense. My lady, please forgive her.

663
00:46:48,960-->00:46:52,760
Isn’t it too late to beg for forgiveness once you’ve already made an error?

664
00:46:52,840-->00:46:54,760
I, as the head of the harem,

665
00:46:54,840-->00:46:58,119
must spare no effort in instructing you what rules are to be followed.

666
00:46:59,519-->00:47:01,320
- Servants! - Yes, my lady.

667
00:47:07,400-->00:47:10,840
Your Majesty and Your Highness, may blessings and peace be with you.

668
00:47:10,920-->00:47:13,879
What a wonderful voice.

669
00:47:19,159-->00:47:21,320
You’ve seldom dressed in such bright colors.

670
00:47:23,359-->00:47:24,359
You may rise.

671
00:47:26,199-->00:47:28,719
What is wrong? You seem out of sorts today.

672
00:47:28,800-->00:47:33,320
Here we are in full daylight. How dare she sing such unseemly songs.

673
00:47:33,399-->00:47:36,239
Tell me. What do you think of the song?

674
00:47:37,360-->00:47:40,599
Attendant An’s singing has a heavenly ring to it.

675
00:47:40,679-->00:47:43,719
Your Highness praises me too highly. I am unworthy of such praise.

676
00:47:44,519-->00:47:47,239
One must pick a flower at the prime of its bloom indeed.

677
00:47:48,39-->00:47:50,879
- What is your name? - An Lingrong.

678
00:47:55,920-->00:47:57,400
Lovely.

679
00:47:57,479-->00:47:59,880
Your voice is refreshing, as are you.

680
00:48:01,999-->00:48:06,119
Your Majesty, I’m a little tired. I’d like to retire.

681
00:48:06,199-->00:48:10,439
Very well. Liuzhu, come. Escort Lady Wan so she may rest.

682
00:48:10,520-->00:48:11,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

683
00:48:12,760-->00:48:15,80
I will return with Huan as well.

684
00:48:28,679-->00:48:35,280
I advise you not to covet golden embroidered garments

685
00:48:35,360-->00:48:38,280
I very much enjoyed Attendant An’s song.

686
00:48:38,359-->00:48:41,679
Have her sing it again for His Majesty and myself.

687
00:48:41,760-->00:48:43,239
Summon Attendant An.

688
00:48:43,320-->00:48:44,599
Yes, Your Highness.

689
00:48:46,599-->00:48:53,520
One must pick a flower at the prime of its bloom

690
00:48:55,480-->00:49:02,360
Do not wait until the blossoms fade and fall

691
00:49:04,360-->00:49:11,280
Do not wait until the blossoms fade and fall

692
00:49:20,600-->00:49:22,639
LADY FUCHA

693
00:49:23,880-->00:49:29,159
Lady Fucha, are you unwell? Did you eat something unclean?

694
00:49:29,840-->00:49:32,599
I inform Your Highness that she is not ill.

695
00:49:32,679-->00:49:33,719
She is with child.

696
00:49:33,800-->00:49:35,400
Nonsense.

697
00:49:36,199-->00:49:40,679
Is it true? Wonderful. It is a joyous occurrence.

698
00:49:41,280-->00:49:43,280
Congratulations are due to His Majesty.

699
00:49:43,360-->00:49:46,880
Is it true? Has an imperial doctor confirmed it?

700
00:49:46,959-->00:49:49,280
Two imperial doctors have confirmed it.

701
00:49:49,360-->00:49:52,800
I’m not the type to say anything to win His Majesty’s favor.

702
00:49:52,880-->00:49:57,280
If pregnant, I say yes. If not, I say no. How could I lie about an imperial heir?

703
00:49:57,360-->00:50:00,40
Isn’t it enough to have Attendant Shen as an example?

704
00:50:00,119-->00:50:02,800
Lady Wan, don’t you agree?

705
00:50:07,800-->00:50:11,439
Young mistress, it’s quite late. Try to sleep now.

706
00:50:11,520-->00:50:16,39
Lady Fucha is with child after serving His Majesty only a few times.

707
00:50:16,760-->00:50:19,920
Yet it has never happened to me.

708
00:50:21,360-->00:50:24,639
I can’t help but think that I lack blessings and good fortune.

709
00:50:24,719-->00:50:25,920
How can it be?

710
00:50:26,839-->00:50:29,159
Mistress, you are fated to enjoy blessings and good fortune.

711
00:50:29,239-->00:50:31,639
Conceiving a child is only a matter of time.

712
00:50:31,719-->00:50:33,479
Do not worry at all, mistress.

713
00:50:34,800-->00:50:38,159
However, I learned from the city guards

714
00:50:38,239-->00:50:41,119
that an epidemic has broken out in the capital city.

715
00:50:41,199-->00:50:43,79
It’s possible that it may spread to the palace.

716
00:50:44,480-->00:50:46,840
Young mistress, you must take extra caution.

717
00:50:49,200-->00:50:50,239
Sleep now.

718
00:50:55,480-->00:50:58,40
My lady, the epidemic has reached the palace.

719
00:50:59,159-->00:51:00,319
What?

720
00:51:00,400-->00:51:02,320
Xiao Dezi, a eunuch in our palace was infected.

721
00:51:02,399-->00:51:04,839
The Imperial Household Department plans to remove him.

722
00:51:05,919-->00:51:07,80
A report, my lady.

723
00:51:07,159-->00:51:10,639
The Empress sends word that the epidemic has reached the palace.

724
00:51:10,719-->00:51:12,400
Your assistance is required.

725
00:51:12,479-->00:51:14,440
The eastern six palaces have been doused

726
00:51:14,519-->00:51:16,440
with boiling liquor and mugwort is burning.

727
00:51:16,520-->00:51:18,719
The western six palaces will be under your management.

728
00:51:20,0-->00:51:21,400
Very well.

729
00:51:22,0-->00:51:23,320
Her Highness also states

730
00:51:23,400-->00:51:27,39
that mugwort must be burned at Cunju Hall where Attendant Shen resides as well.

731
00:51:27,119-->00:51:29,440
No palace among the six is to be left out.

732
00:51:29,519-->00:51:33,280
Report to Her Highness that I will get the job done.

733
00:51:34,280-->00:51:35,559
Yes, my lady.

734
00:51:37,800-->00:51:42,479
I was unable to eliminate Shen Meizhuang. She has tremendous luck.

735
00:51:43,239-->00:51:44,840
But if Attendant Shen should die,

736
00:51:44,919-->00:51:48,639
even though Liu Ben were to be caught, there would be no one to confront him.

737
00:51:49,439-->00:51:52,840
Is there anything of use to us in Xiao Dezi’s quarters?

738
00:51:53,639-->00:51:56,800
There is a tea set that he used after contracting the disease.

739
00:51:57,400-->00:51:58,679
Send it to Cunju Hall.

740
00:52:00,40-->00:52:01,39
Understood.

741
00:52:11,79-->00:52:13,79
Two patients died this morning.

742
00:52:13,159-->00:52:15,360
This epidemic threatens us all.

743
00:52:15,440-->00:52:17,840
Not even the Imperial Medical Bureau has a remedy.

744
00:52:18,880-->00:52:20,479
Young mistress, bad news!

745
00:52:20,559-->00:52:21,840
Slowly.

746
00:52:21,919-->00:52:24,239
Xianfu Palace informs us that Mistress Meizhuang is ill.

747
00:52:26,679-->00:52:28,519
Young mistress.

748
00:52:28,599-->00:52:31,559
Mistress Meizhuang is already ill. You must think of your own health.

749
00:52:31,639-->00:52:35,879
- Just one look. - Who else will defend Mistress Meizhuang?

750
00:52:40,639-->00:52:41,920
Young mistress.

751
00:52:44,480-->00:52:47,199
Please take good care of Mei.

752
00:52:49,79-->00:52:52,559
If I had one request for you, could you help me?

753
00:52:53,480-->00:52:57,479
I must remind you, if you succeed, you may receive no recognition.

754
00:52:57,560-->00:52:59,400
And if others find out, you may be blamed.

755
00:53:00,119-->00:53:03,719
But if I don’t do this, I’m afraid my heart will never rest easy.

756
00:53:03,800-->00:53:07,199
To give you peace, I’m prepared to do all that I can.

757
00:53:08,239-->00:53:10,39
I am at your disposal.

758
00:53:15,440-->00:53:18,960
Doctor Wen, you’re working so hard. Haven’t you taken a rest yet?

759
00:53:20,239-->00:53:21,559
Doctor Jiang.

760
00:53:22,280-->00:53:26,199
Recently you have been caring for all the concubines by day

761
00:53:26,280-->00:53:27,320
JIANG SHEN

762
00:53:27,400-->00:53:29,760
while also working on a remedy for the epidemic by night.

763
00:53:29,840-->00:53:31,760
You must be exhausted.

764
00:53:31,840-->00:53:33,439
Is there any progress?

765
00:53:34,960-->00:53:38,359
Not yet. But I’ll do my best to develop it.

766
00:53:38,440-->00:53:40,520
Then please return to your work.

767
00:53:41,439-->00:53:46,239
I’ve secretly arranged for Doctor Wen to treat her.

768
00:53:46,320-->00:53:49,760
However, we’re short of medicine, and her diet is not good.

769
00:53:50,760-->00:53:55,79
Mistress Meizhuang isn’t getting any better.

770
00:53:58,0-->00:54:00,639
Congratulations, young mistress. We’ve found the one you requested.

771
00:54:01,239-->00:54:02,320
So it is you.

772
00:54:03,520-->00:54:07,40
I never believed that Attendant Shen would feign pregnancy to win favor.

773
00:54:07,119-->00:54:09,199
So I secretly began to search for Liu Ben.

774
00:54:09,280-->00:54:12,360
Our efforts have finally paid off. He was caught at the border of Yongzhou.

775
00:54:13,879-->00:54:16,679
We will not torture you to force a confession.

776
00:54:16,760-->00:54:19,800
But if you dare tell any lies,

777
00:54:20,679-->00:54:23,639
you will suffer pain much worse than death.

778
00:54:24,239-->00:54:26,760
Your Majesty, Mistress Meizhuang was never pregnant.

779
00:54:27,879-->00:54:29,40
I’m aware of that.

780
00:54:29,119-->00:54:32,520
But Mistress Meizhuang did not know that she was not with child.

781
00:54:33,239-->00:54:37,40
When I started taking care of her, her menstruation had already stopped.

782
00:54:37,119-->00:54:41,520
The symptoms of dizziness and nausea were caused by medicine, not pregnancy.

783
00:54:42,360-->00:54:45,440
I received orders before examining Mistress Meizhuang.

784
00:54:45,519-->00:54:48,479
No matter what, I was to report that she was pregnant.

785
00:54:48,560-->00:54:51,719
Received orders? From whom?

786
00:54:51,800-->00:54:53,80
From–

787
00:54:53,679-->00:54:56,520
She planned to have you killed. Will you still hide her guilt?

788
00:54:58,320-->00:55:00,959
Consort Hua. It was Consort Hua.

789
00:55:01,599-->00:55:03,599
That day, Consort Hua gave me a sum of money

790
00:55:03,679-->00:55:06,119
and told me to leave Yuanming Palace at once to avoid trouble.

791
00:55:06,199-->00:55:09,520
As soon as I entered the city, I was chased by killers.

792
00:55:09,599-->00:55:13,280
I was forced to become an outcast and wander like a homeless dog.

793
00:55:14,440-->00:55:18,320
Xiao Yunzi, keep a close watch over him. Don’t let anything happen.

794
00:55:18,399-->00:55:19,600
Yes, young mistress.

795
00:55:19,679-->00:55:20,840
Get up.

796
00:55:21,840-->00:55:23,440
Your Majesty, please quiet your anger.

797
00:55:23,520-->00:55:27,600
Is it possible Liu Ben did not reveal the whole truth?

798
00:55:27,679-->00:55:29,760
Actually there are many doubts about what happened that day.

799
00:55:29,840-->00:55:31,880
But we have no evidence.

800
00:55:31,959-->00:55:34,400
If Attendant Shen truly did have her menstruation a few days before,

801
00:55:34,920-->00:55:37,480
the stained clothes could have been discarded at any time.

802
00:55:37,559-->00:55:39,80
Why was it done in your presence?

803
00:55:42,560-->00:55:43,879
Consort Hua.

804
00:55:45,800-->00:55:46,800
Very well.

805
00:55:47,880-->00:55:50,39
We have wronged Mei.

806
00:55:50,119-->00:55:52,880
Release her and restore her rank at once.

807
00:55:52,959-->00:55:55,399
- I’m afraid she can’t go out now. - Did she–

808
00:55:55,480-->00:55:58,199
No, Mei did not take her life.

809
00:55:59,119-->00:56:02,199
Unfortunately, she’s contracted the disease in her extreme sorrow.

810
00:56:02,920-->00:56:08,119
We shall order the imperial doctors to treat Noble Lady Hui at once.

811
00:56:08,199-->00:56:10,999
We must let her live a good life from now on.

812
00:56:13,519-->00:56:16,120
Your Majesty, please forgive my impertinence.

813
00:56:16,199-->00:56:18,479
Seeing that Attendant Shen was seriously ill,

814
00:56:18,560-->00:56:21,800
I privately requested an imperial doctor to save her life.

815
00:56:21,880-->00:56:24,679
- Is that so? - Your Majesty, please forgive me.

816
00:56:24,760-->00:56:28,0
If it hadn’t been for you risking your life to take such measures,

817
00:56:28,719-->00:56:32,480
I’m afraid I would be faced with deep regret over Lady Hui.

818
00:56:32,560-->00:56:34,320
Your Majesty is blameless.

819
00:56:34,400-->00:56:37,280
It was those guileful schemers. They clouded Your Majesty’s clear vision.

820
00:56:40,439-->00:56:41,679
Su Peisheng.

821
00:56:46,39-->00:56:47,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

822
00:56:47,399-->00:56:50,0
Deliver my order to the Imperial Medical Bureau.

823
00:56:50,960-->00:56:53,760
Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen are decreed to take their own lives.

824
00:56:53,840-->00:56:57,560
Consort Hua’s honorific name is revoked. She is demoted to Noble Lady.

825
00:56:58,199-->00:57:00,400
The demotion of Consort Hua–

826
00:57:00,480-->00:57:01,760
It’s already midnight.

827
00:57:01,840-->00:57:04,200
If we ask the Imperial Household Department to deliver your decree,

828
00:57:04,280-->00:57:06,719
I’m afraid it will disturb the entire harem.

829
00:57:07,480-->00:57:09,320
Then wait until tomorrow.

830
00:57:09,399-->00:57:11,79
Go to Cunju Hall first.

831
00:57:11,159-->00:57:13,800
Announce that we have reinstated Lady Shen to her former rank.

832
00:57:13,879-->00:57:15,559
Her honorific name is restored.

833
00:57:16,159-->00:57:18,719
- The most urgent matter is to cure her. - Yes, Your Majesty.

834
00:57:19,439-->00:57:22,0
What? Liu Ben has been found?

835
00:57:22,80-->00:57:24,159
I knew nothing of it until I overheard a conversation

836
00:57:24,239-->00:57:27,79
between First Attendant An’s maid and our servants.

837
00:57:28,400-->00:57:30,0
It must be Zhen Huan.

838
00:57:31,120-->00:57:35,119
The Jiang brothers could not keep themselves out of trouble either.

839
00:57:35,199-->00:57:39,239
Zhou Ninghai, tell those two to keep their mouths shut.

840
00:57:39,320-->00:57:41,719
Understood. I’ll do so right away.

841
00:57:45,80-->00:57:47,840
My lady, it would be wise to silence those two men.

842
00:57:47,920-->00:57:50,760
But if you want to change His Majesty’s mind,

843
00:57:50,840-->00:57:53,520
you can’t simply expect that His Majesty will soften out of affection for you.

844
00:57:53,599-->00:57:56,199
You must offer him what he most desires at this moment.

845
00:57:58,40-->00:58:02,439
My lady, if you are guilty of a fault, His Majesty is obliged to punish you.

846
00:58:02,520-->00:58:06,40
Faults must be punished, but achievements must be rewarded.

847
00:58:08,719-->00:58:10,439
Why have you come in such haste?

848
00:58:11,39-->00:58:13,479
Your Majesty, congratulations. I have just learned

849
00:58:13,559-->00:58:17,920
that Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen have developed a remedy for the epidemic.

850
00:58:17,999-->00:58:21,0
I have brought the two imperial doctors here to report to you.

851
00:58:23,40-->00:58:26,679
Your Majesty, most disease is caused by unsanitary food

852
00:58:26,760-->00:58:28,960
and leads to damage of the spleen, stomach and intestine.

853
00:58:29,40-->00:58:30,959
We’ve pored over ancient books

854
00:58:31,39-->00:58:34,239
and developed a remedy, an emergency disease preparation.

855
00:58:34,320-->00:58:36,599
Several young eunuchs have already taken the medicine.

856
00:58:37,360-->00:58:39,679
After taking two doses, they showed a reduction of fever.

857
00:58:40,960-->00:58:43,840
Good.

858
00:58:47,480-->00:58:48,760
My lady.

859
00:58:51,0-->00:58:53,440
Your Majesty, please forgive my discourtesy.

860
00:58:54,239-->00:58:56,800
Are you unwell? Take your seat quickly.

861
00:58:56,880-->00:58:57,879
Thank you, Your Majesty.

862
00:58:57,960-->00:59:01,719
Consort Hua recalled that disease remedies may be found in ancient books.

863
00:59:01,800-->00:59:03,520
She stayed up last night reading through books.

864
00:59:04,200-->00:59:06,640
Over the last few days she has done the same.

865
00:59:06,719-->00:59:08,999
Perhaps that is why she feels weak.

866
00:59:10,160-->00:59:12,79
My beloved, you are tired.

867
00:59:14,239-->00:59:16,39
- Su Peisheng. - Your Majesty.

868
00:59:16,120-->00:59:19,320
Take your men and accompany Doctor Jiang to the Medical Bureau.

869
00:59:19,400-->00:59:22,280
Deliver the medicine to Lady Hui’s residence at Cunju Hall first.

870
00:59:22,360-->00:59:24,800
Then give it to every servant in the palace who has been infected.

871
00:59:24,880-->00:59:26,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

872
00:59:34,39-->00:59:35,479
Lady Hui?

873
00:59:36,760-->00:59:40,239
We have already restored Shen’s rank.

874
00:59:41,159-->00:59:43,919
We’ve wronged her over what happened in the past.

875
00:59:44,480-->00:59:47,760
Your Majesty, I dare not ask you to forgive my past recklessness.

876
00:59:47,840-->00:59:52,40
I only ask that you do not risk your own health in anger over me.

877
00:59:53,480-->00:59:55,560
I’m merely one insignificant individual.

878
00:59:55,639-->00:59:58,919
But your health matters to everyone in this land.

879
00:59:59,0-->01:0:3,880
All right. Today you’ve made a great achievement.

880
01:0:5,79-->01:0:7,800
If this remedy can cure the epidemic,

881
01:0:8,440-->01:0:10,199
it will prove a blessing to us all.

882
01:0:10,920-->01:0:14,79
I’m not the kind to fail in dispensing rewards and punishment.

883
01:0:16,359-->01:0:18,199
Your Majesty, you’re divinely wise.

884
01:0:29,599-->01:0:33,280
Doctor Wen, Doctor Jiang told us to deliver this remedy to Lady Hui.

885
01:0:33,360-->01:0:37,440
What? Doctor Jiang has developed a remedy for the disease as well?

886
01:0:38,119-->01:0:39,320
Place it here.

887
01:0:48,639-->01:0:54,39
Lady Hui, there has been one doubt in my mind all along.

888
01:0:54,880-->01:0:56,280
Tell me.

889
01:0:56,960-->01:0:59,639
Does it seem you contracted the disease too suddenly?

890
01:1:0,440-->01:1:4,79
I remember that the epidemic reached us first at Consort Hua’s palace.

891
01:1:4,920-->01:1:6,599
Then your palace followed.

892
01:1:6,679-->01:1:8,760
At the time, you were confined to your palace.

893
01:1:8,840-->01:1:11,960
You had no contact with Consort Hua’s servants.

894
01:1:12,39-->01:1:14,440
How did you catch the disease so suddenly?

895
01:1:19,960-->01:1:23,719
The Imperial Household Department ordered me to send you a new tea set.

896
01:1:23,800-->01:1:26,239
The tea is ready now. Please enjoy.

897
01:1:29,480-->01:1:31,80
It was her!

898
01:1:31,679-->01:1:33,320
Mei, please be calm.

899
01:1:33,399-->01:1:35,879
We have no evidence at the moment.

900
01:1:36,479-->01:1:37,999
I have another doubt.

901
01:1:38,639-->01:1:41,479
Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen are studied in women’s health and infant care.

902
01:1:42,239-->01:1:46,120
How could they suddenly make a leap to the treatment of diseases?

903
01:1:46,199-->01:1:50,280
If I say that the remedy was mostly developed by myself,

904
01:1:51,40-->01:1:54,639
- will you believe me? - Yes, you are capable.

905
01:1:55,439-->01:1:58,40
But His Majesty has already said that they are of great merit.

906
01:1:59,0-->01:2:2,199
If you say anything now, nobody will believe your words.

907
01:2:4,200-->01:2:7,919
Your Majesty, does Lady Wan serve you well?

908
01:2:7,999-->01:2:10,120
That’s hard to answer.

909
01:2:10,199-->01:2:12,0
If I say she serves me well,

910
01:2:12,79-->01:2:14,919
and then I do not dress warmly in order to enjoy the bracing cold,

911
01:2:15,0-->01:2:18,160
Queen Mother will blame her for it.

912
01:2:18,239-->01:2:20,280
If I say she doesn’t serve me well–

913
01:2:21,360-->01:2:24,719
In fact, she is very attentive.

914
01:2:25,920-->01:2:30,679
But I’ve been busy with my duties. I haven’t seen her for several days.

915
01:2:31,159-->01:2:33,599
Your Majesty has been occupied with affairs of state.

916
01:2:33,679-->01:2:36,679
It’s a mere few days that you haven’t met with her.

917
01:2:36,760-->01:2:40,160
How often do you meet with Consort Hua?

918
01:2:40,239-->01:2:41,920
How often do you meet with the Empress?

919
01:2:42,600-->01:2:45,440
How often do you meet with Concubine Jing and the rest of them?

920
01:2:45,519-->01:2:47,560
Since Your Majesty is busy,

921
01:2:47,639-->01:2:50,280
you may meet all of the concubines much less frequently.

922
01:2:50,879-->01:2:53,679
But if you show partiality to one,

923
01:2:53,760-->01:2:55,999
then you aggrieve the others.

924
01:2:57,879-->01:2:59,959
Queen Mother, I have learned from you.

925
01:3:0,40-->01:3:1,920
I will bear this in mind.

926
01:3:3,39-->01:3:7,919
Such fine black fox fur may only be found in Qinghai.

927
01:3:9,719-->01:3:12,119
Your Majesty has a keen eye and a clear heart.

928
01:3:12,199-->01:3:14,959
It is quite dim here, yet you still recognize this black fox fur.

929
01:3:15,559-->01:3:19,400
When you behold the harem and the court, of course it’s as clear as day to you.

930
01:3:20,119-->01:3:21,719
This black fox cloak

931
01:3:21,800-->01:3:24,39
has a satin lining selected by Consort Hua,

932
01:3:24,120-->01:3:26,360
embroidered with passionflowers.

933
01:3:26,439-->01:3:29,239
When inside and outside are balanced, there is harmony in the whole.

934
01:3:31,639-->01:3:34,800
Queen Mother, I understand what you have just taught me.

935
01:3:36,0-->01:3:40,520
You should temper justice with mercy, not only in the court,

936
01:3:40,599-->01:3:43,159
but also in the harem.

937
01:3:43,760-->01:3:47,719
The pacification of the Northwest is nearly complete.

938
01:3:48,320-->01:3:51,760
But the chieftain of the Southwest is still a thorn in our side.

939
01:3:51,840-->01:3:54,520
If we have to calm the situation, it will take great effort.

940
01:3:55,840-->01:3:58,280
Nian Gengyao displays great talent and acceptable loyalty.

941
01:3:58,360-->01:4:2,240
Such a meritorious official, providing he grows not overly arrogant,

942
01:4:2,320-->01:4:4,879
should be put to proper use by Your Majesty.

943
01:4:5,480-->01:4:8,159
Calming the situation on the western frontier shows true merit.

944
01:4:8,239-->01:4:11,679
He will surely be highly rewarded.

945
01:4:20,600-->01:4:22,519
- My lady. - Has my brother returned?

946
01:4:22,599-->01:4:25,319
The General has calmed the situation on the frontier and has just returned.

947
01:4:25,399-->01:4:27,640
He has gone to greet His Majesty.

948
01:4:27,720-->01:4:29,160
My lady.

949
01:4:31,80-->01:4:34,559
On His Majesty’s order, please come to Yangxin Hall to dine.

950
01:4:36,599-->01:4:40,39
Wait outside. I’ll come immediately.

951
01:4:43,559-->01:4:47,40
This is grilled mutton. It’s fresh, tender and savory.

952
01:4:47,119-->01:4:50,879
My favorite dish. Try it yourself.

953
01:4:59,919-->01:5:1,160
Delicious indeed.

954
01:5:2,880-->01:5:4,199
Brother.

955
01:5:4,280-->01:5:8,439
When His Majesty grants you a feast, you must be served by imperial servants.

956
01:5:8,519-->01:5:10,759
NIAN GENGYAO

957
01:5:10,840-->01:5:15,80
Your Majesty, I’ve been discourteous. Please don’t hold it against me.

958
01:5:17,40-->01:5:19,480
You have been far away at battle for a long time.

959
01:5:19,960-->01:5:22,639
Of course you are used to attending to every detail yourself.

960
01:5:22,719-->01:5:24,200
It’s of no importance.

961
01:5:32,400-->01:5:36,79
The edible bird’s nest with duck placed before me looks quite good.

962
01:5:38,439-->01:5:40,759
I’d like to trouble Eunuch Su.

963
01:6:5,480-->01:6:7,319
General, please enjoy.

964
01:6:10,399-->01:6:14,119
What a rare chance to eat at the same table as the Emperor.

965
01:6:23,200-->01:6:27,560
Very well. Let us enjoy this meal.

966
01:6:31,199-->01:6:33,520
Your Majesty, you’ve been keeping me company recently,

967
01:6:34,119-->01:6:36,239
without visiting the others.

968
01:6:38,0-->01:6:40,239
Since you strive to be a generous concubine,

969
01:6:40,840-->01:6:44,0
then I will pay a visit to Consort Qi and the others.

970
01:6:44,599-->01:6:45,639
Your Majesty.

971
01:6:46,279-->01:6:48,520
I know you are reluctant to part with me.

972
01:6:50,40-->01:6:52,400
Your Majesty, you always enjoy listening to Attendant An sing.

973
01:6:53,200-->01:6:55,399
I haven’t heard her for quite some time.

974
01:6:56,39-->01:6:59,399
Why don’t we ask her to come sing for us?

975
01:6:59,479-->01:7:2,999
Let me take this chance to enjoy it together with you once.

976
01:7:3,559-->01:7:6,599
It is late at night. Why should we trouble her?

977
01:7:6,680-->01:7:7,959
Your Majesty.

978
01:7:11,80-->01:7:14,559
If you want to call her, you may do as you wish.

979
01:7:14,639-->01:7:17,119
I greet Lady Wan and First Attendant An.

980
01:7:17,960-->01:7:19,559
May good fortune be with you.

981
01:7:19,639-->01:7:21,439
Eunuch Zhou, why have you come?

982
01:7:22,40-->01:7:24,480
His Majesty wishes to hear Attendant An sing.

983
01:7:25,39-->01:7:26,599
He awaits you at Yikun Palace.

984
01:7:31,479-->01:7:34,559
His Majesty is visiting Consort Hua. What am I if I go there?

985
01:7:35,359-->01:7:36,560
His Majesty awaits.

986
01:7:36,639-->01:7:40,679
If you intend to defy the order, you should reply to it yourself.

987
01:7:40,759-->01:7:43,440
Don’t make it difficult for us. We are merely servants.

988
01:7:49,760-->01:7:52,159
Jinxi, fetch my zither.

989
01:7:52,239-->01:7:53,599
Young mistress.

990
01:7:54,519-->01:7:56,119
Singing without accompaniment is monotonous.

991
01:7:56,200-->01:7:59,880
I’d like to join Attendant An and play the zither to entertain His Majesty.

992
01:8:2,320-->01:8:4,960
By order of Your Highness, I went to Yikun Palace

993
01:8:5,40-->01:8:6,920
to report that the Empress is ill and will be

994
01:8:6,999-->01:8:8,920
absent for the chrysanthemum viewing.

995
01:8:9,519-->01:8:11,80
To my surprise, Xiao Xiazi told me

996
01:8:11,159-->01:8:14,839
that Lady Wan and Attendant An were summoned to entertain Consort Hua.

997
01:8:14,919-->01:8:16,520
I watched for a while out of curiosity.

998
01:8:17,240-->01:8:19,600
When Lady Wan and Attendant An came out,

999
01:8:19,680-->01:8:22,359
they were perfectly calm as if nothing had happened.

1000
01:8:22,439-->01:8:26,239
I know the temperament of Lady Wan. She is not easily perturbed.

1001
01:8:27,640-->01:8:31,399
But I never imagined that Attendant An could bear it as well.

1002
01:8:32,240-->01:8:34,920
It seems that I haven’t paid much attention to An lately.

1003
01:8:34,999-->01:8:37,600
Consort Hua has been overly arrogant and capricious.

1004
01:8:37,680-->01:8:40,79
But First Attendant An–

1005
01:8:40,159-->01:8:42,0
She is quite good.

1006
01:8:42,80-->01:8:45,680
Huan, we are not performers who sing for a living.

1007
01:8:46,359-->01:8:48,319
How can she humiliate us that way?

1008
01:8:50,879-->01:8:52,399
Don’t cry.

1009
01:8:53,0-->01:8:55,600
Have some water to soothe your throat.

1010
01:8:55,680-->01:8:59,800
Huan, you were humiliated as well just because of me.

1011
01:9:0,680-->01:9:2,479
If it were not for your presence,

1012
01:9:2,560-->01:9:4,920
as His Majesty was considerate of you,

1013
01:9:5,520-->01:9:8,600
I can’t imagine how much humiliation I would have had to take from her.

1014
01:9:10,359-->01:9:12,759
His Majesty holds Nian Gengyao in high regard.

1015
01:9:12,839-->01:9:15,0
Consort Hua is gloating.

1016
01:9:15,960-->01:9:18,719
His Majesty must consider the overall situation.

1017
01:9:18,799-->01:9:21,959
It would not be wise of him to offend her openly for our sake.

1018
01:9:22,40-->01:9:23,879
As long as Nian Gengyao exists,

1019
01:9:24,959-->01:9:28,80
His Majesty will not neglect Consort Hua.

1020
01:9:30,360-->01:9:33,240
The spread of the epidemic in the palace has been checked.

1021
01:9:33,319-->01:9:35,320
Consort Hua is congratulated.

1022
01:9:35,399-->01:9:39,479
Starting today, Consort Hua regains power to assist in affairs of the harem.

1023
01:9:43,640-->01:9:45,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1024
01:9:46,239-->01:9:47,560
Congratulations, Hua.

1025
01:9:50,120-->01:9:54,200
Concubine Jing has been serving me for eight or nine years.

1026
01:9:54,279-->01:9:57,280
She is hereby promoted to Consort Jing.

1027
01:10:0,360-->01:10:2,240
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

1028
01:10:2,840-->01:10:5,159
The conferring ceremony will be held on the 19th of next month.

1029
01:10:5,999-->01:10:9,800
I will discharge my duties and share the burden with Her Highness the Empress.

1030
01:10:15,960-->01:10:16,960
Mei and Huan.

1031
01:10:18,479-->01:10:19,960
Mei and Huan, help me!

1032
01:10:20,40-->01:10:22,439
- Lingrong, what’s the matter? - Get up, speak slowly.

1033
01:10:22,520-->01:10:25,79
Mei and Huan, my father has been imprisoned.

1034
01:10:25,880-->01:10:28,479
How could such a thing happen?

1035
01:10:28,560-->01:10:29,800
I received a letter from home.

1036
01:10:29,880-->01:10:32,359
It said that the Magistrate of Songyang County, Jiang Wenqing,

1037
01:10:32,439-->01:10:34,359
was convoying provisions to the Northwest.

1038
01:10:34,439-->01:10:36,920
My father was a member of the escort group.

1039
01:10:36,999-->01:10:40,520
However, they encountered deserters of the enemy

1040
01:10:40,600-->01:10:42,880
and the military provisions were snatched.

1041
01:10:42,959-->01:10:44,600
His Majesty was furious.

1042
01:10:44,680-->01:10:48,160
Jiang Wenqing was captured immediately and was imprisoned along with my father.

1043
01:10:48,999-->01:10:51,279
I’m afraid that in a fit of rage,

1044
01:10:51,359-->01:10:54,159
His Majesty will kill my father.

1045
01:10:54,239-->01:10:55,640
This matter concerns your family.

1046
01:10:55,720-->01:10:57,959
Of course we will intercede with His Majesty.

1047
01:10:58,39-->01:11:0,800
I’m overwhelmed with gratitude.

1048
01:11:0,880-->01:11:2,479
Lingrong.

1049
01:11:2,560-->01:11:5,840
Lady Hui, are you here to plead for the father of Attendant An?

1050
01:11:5,920-->01:11:8,239
Yes, I can’t sit by and do nothing.

1051
01:11:8,319-->01:11:10,120
You’d better do nothing.

1052
01:11:11,39-->01:11:14,39
Think about it. If you write a letter to your parents,

1053
01:11:14,119-->01:11:16,960
of course, your father will give a mild punishment.

1054
01:11:17,40-->01:11:19,640
But if someone raises objections to this,

1055
01:11:19,720-->01:11:22,279
His Majesty will be furious.

1056
01:11:22,359-->01:11:25,479
Then what of your father’s future?

1057
01:11:26,359-->01:11:29,39
Besides, once you intervene

1058
01:11:29,119-->01:11:30,720
and Consort Hua learns of it,

1059
01:11:31,600-->01:11:34,560
Attendant An’s father will surely be put to death.

1060
01:11:37,680-->01:11:41,200
As soon as the Empress left Consort Hua arrived.

1061
01:11:41,800-->01:11:43,720
They came for the same person.

1062
01:11:44,319-->01:11:47,560
Did they come for Attendant An’s father, An Bihuai?

1063
01:11:47,640-->01:11:48,960
Exactly.

1064
01:11:50,159-->01:11:52,359
Let me guess.

1065
01:11:53,79-->01:11:55,79
Her Highness the Empress is kind and virtuous.

1066
01:11:55,159-->01:11:57,39
She interceded on behalf of Attendant An’s father.

1067
01:11:57,759-->01:11:59,880
Consort Hua is righteous and tenacious.

1068
01:11:59,960-->01:12:1,999
She must have asked my dear to enforce the law strictly,

1069
01:12:2,79-->01:12:4,40
and to remain unswayed by personal considerations.

1070
01:12:4,119-->01:12:5,240
And what say you?

1071
01:12:5,320-->01:12:8,319
Concubines should not meddle in affairs of state. I always bear this in mind.

1072
01:12:12,640-->01:12:14,319
As a child, I studied history books.

1073
01:12:14,399-->01:12:16,840
I learned that when the wise Emperors punished their officials,

1074
01:12:16,919-->01:12:17,960
they would punish the leader yet forgive

1075
01:12:18,40-->01:12:19,520
the follower, balancing justice with mercy.

1076
01:12:19,600-->01:12:22,920
The people not only revered them, but also admired their clemency.

1077
01:12:23,479-->01:12:25,39
I am ignorant in these matters.

1078
01:12:25,120-->01:12:27,759
Battles are fought outside the palace. Discipline is maintained within.

1079
01:12:27,839-->01:12:30,279
If both are clearly settled, then the nation will thrive in peace.

1080
01:12:32,79-->01:12:35,879
I already knew you were well-read in the classics,

1081
01:12:36,959-->01:12:39,239
but did not expect you to be versed in history and national policy.

1082
01:12:40,920-->01:12:43,159
Your words did not concern affairs of state,

1083
01:12:43,239-->01:12:46,239
yet you advised through history.

1084
01:12:46,880-->01:12:50,359
We will send someone to reinvestigate An Bihuai’s case,

1085
01:12:50,439-->01:12:52,479
and shall let no one suffer a wrong.

1086
01:12:54,720-->01:12:57,239
Congratulations, young mistress.

1087
01:12:57,319-->01:12:59,479
You’re too kind. What is it?

1088
01:12:59,560-->01:13:2,79
This morning His Majesty ordered Shen Zishan, Colonel of Jizhou Garrison,

1089
01:13:2,160-->01:13:4,520
to reexamine your father’s case.

1090
01:13:4,600-->01:13:6,760
Hopefully, your father will live.

1091
01:13:8,319-->01:13:10,359
- Is it true? - Of course.

1092
01:13:10,439-->01:13:12,839
Yesterday the Empress interceded with His Majesty.

1093
01:13:13,479-->01:13:16,239
Of course His Majesty won’t disappoint her.

1094
01:13:16,319-->01:13:18,600
- Thanks to the Empress. - Don’t–

1095
01:13:20,439-->01:13:22,79
If such things may befall me,

1096
01:13:22,159-->01:13:25,600
I know that I can rely on nothing.

1097
01:13:27,839-->01:13:29,639
I finally understand now.

1098
01:13:29,720-->01:13:33,279
One word from the Empress is much more powerful than any others.

1099
01:13:33,359-->01:13:35,479
Of course. Besides the Empress Dowager,

1100
01:13:35,560-->01:13:38,479
Her Highness the Empress is the most powerful woman in the palace.

1101
01:13:41,39-->01:13:46,119
Your Highness, I made a sachet and would like to present it to you.

1102
01:13:46,199-->01:13:49,720
I hope that Your Highness will not dislike it due to my unskillful handwork.

1103
01:13:54,359-->01:13:56,359
What an exquisite sachet.

1104
01:13:58,0-->01:14:1,399
Its fragrance is delicate and elegant.

1105
01:14:1,479-->01:14:3,399
It contains peony and orchid,

1106
01:14:3,479-->01:14:5,680
mixed with eaglewood and pine needle.

1107
01:14:5,760-->01:14:7,560
Though the sachet is wonderful,

1108
01:14:7,640-->01:14:10,920
it is a pity that I usually don’t use perfume.

1109
01:14:12,640-->01:14:14,239
I had not noticed.

1110
01:14:14,319-->01:14:16,160
Every time I come to greet Your Highness,

1111
01:14:16,239-->01:14:17,479
I only notice that your palace is filled with

1112
01:14:17,560-->01:14:19,920
the fragrance of fresh flowers and fruits.

1113
01:14:19,999-->01:14:23,239
But I was not aware that Your Highness doesn’t like perfume at all.

1114
01:14:23,319-->01:14:25,359
I’m quite careless.

1115
01:14:25,439-->01:14:27,280
It’s not that I don’t like perfume.

1116
01:14:27,880-->01:14:29,639
But I must remind you

1117
01:14:29,720-->01:14:33,359
that certain perfumes may do harm to your health if used improperly.

1118
01:14:34,640-->01:14:36,640
Thank you for your counsel, Your Highness.

1119
01:14:37,479-->01:14:41,680
As you understand perfumes, you must know how terrible they can be.

1120
01:14:44,239-->01:14:47,240
It’s springtime. Even the cats are starting to wail.

1121
01:14:47,999-->01:14:53,560
Other cats will yowl. But my cat, Songzi, loves to pounce.

1122
01:14:54,560-->01:14:57,520
Cats are not easy to train when in heat.

1123
01:14:58,159-->01:15:0,439
But they are quite susceptible to scents.

1124
01:15:1,119-->01:15:4,279
They can be trained once accustomed to certain scents.

1125
01:15:4,359-->01:15:8,439
Very good. The flowers at Jingren Palace are in full bloom.

1126
01:15:8,520-->01:15:12,439
I will invite all the concubines to the palace to view them.

1127
01:15:13,159-->01:15:14,199
Yes, Your Highness.

1128
01:15:21,120-->01:15:25,39
Consort Jing and Consort Hua became concubines of His Majesty on the same day.

1129
01:15:25,120-->01:15:26,720
Now Jing has been promoted to Consort,

1130
01:15:26,800-->01:15:29,239
and will help Consort Hua to assist in affairs of the harem.

1131
01:15:29,319-->01:15:33,240
It is a blessing that you now have a helper.

1132
01:15:33,319-->01:15:36,479
But even more so for me since I can enjoy my leisure time now.

1133
01:15:37,600-->01:15:40,600
Lady Fucha, you’ve viewed the flowers for a while, your makeup has run.

1134
01:15:44,600-->01:15:48,79
It truly must be a gift from His Majesty. Your powder smells so good.

1135
01:16:11,520-->01:16:13,80
- Young mistress. - Call the imperial doctor.

1136
01:16:13,159-->01:16:15,360
Young mistress, are you all right?

1137
01:16:15,439-->01:16:17,560
- Are you all right? - It hurts.

1138
01:16:17,640-->01:16:19,879
Are you all right? Young mistress, don’t worry.

1139
01:16:29,80-->01:16:30,680
It’s hopeless.

1140
01:16:32,79-->01:16:34,520
Who is the owner of that beast?

1141
01:16:35,520-->01:16:37,479
I am to blame.

1142
01:16:37,560-->01:16:40,880
The cat is named Songzi. It was given to me by Consort Qi.

1143
01:16:40,959-->01:16:44,39
I only kept it as a pet for pleasure.

1144
01:16:44,119-->01:16:47,840
Songzi is usually very gentle. But she suddenly went wild today.

1145
01:16:47,919-->01:16:49,319
It is truly my fault.

1146
01:16:51,439-->01:16:52,439
You may rise.

1147
01:16:56,39-->01:16:57,199
What happened to Lady Wan?

1148
01:16:57,920-->01:17:0,520
Lady Wan stumbled when she attempted to save Lady Fucha.

1149
01:17:0,600-->01:17:2,640
Maybe she was injured.

1150
01:17:2,719-->01:17:4,879
Imperial doctor, check on Lady Wan.

1151
01:17:4,960-->01:17:6,279
Yes, Your Highness.

1152
01:17:16,279-->01:17:20,199
Congratulations, young mistress. You are with child, about two months.

1153
01:17:24,0-->01:17:25,560
Wonderful.

1154
01:17:26,880-->01:17:28,119
Don’t move.

1155
01:17:28,199-->01:17:30,680
You sit down. Sit down.

1156
01:17:32,79-->01:17:36,40
Doctor Zhang, are you certain that Lady Wan is with child?

1157
01:17:36,120-->01:17:37,879
I’ve been a doctor for several decades.

1158
01:17:37,959-->01:17:40,759
I’m quite confident of my diagnosis.

1159
01:17:40,840-->01:17:43,600
What happened today was entirely unexpected.

1160
01:17:43,680-->01:17:45,999
But Lady Wan, you’re quite careless.

1161
01:17:46,80-->01:17:48,279
You didn’t even realize that you were with child

1162
01:17:48,359-->01:17:50,399
and threw yourself down to save another.

1163
01:17:50,479-->01:17:52,79
It’s fortunate that you weren’t hurt.

1164
01:17:52,680-->01:17:54,879
What if an accident were to happen?

1165
01:17:54,959-->01:17:58,800
This is important news vital to the imperial family.

1166
01:17:58,880-->01:18:1,880
If I were to say that I was pushed, would you believe me?

1167
01:18:3,880-->01:18:5,960
I guess the true intention of that person

1168
01:18:6,40-->01:18:8,79
was to make me strike Lady Fucha’s belly.

1169
01:18:9,79-->01:18:12,759
If Lady Fucha were to miscarry, then I would be to blame.

1170
01:18:12,839-->01:18:14,479
Kill two birds with one stone.

1171
01:18:14,560-->01:18:16,800
Among the concubines in the harem,

1172
01:18:16,880-->01:18:19,799
those who carry a child will become the targets of all the others.

1173
01:18:20,600-->01:18:24,200
I’m afraid there are many who will not sleep well tonight.

1174
01:18:24,279-->01:18:25,560
Precisely.

1175
01:18:25,640-->01:18:28,560
Those who could not sleep due to Lady Fucha’s pregnancy

1176
01:18:28,640-->01:18:30,919
can finally sleep well tonight.

1177
01:18:31,520-->01:18:33,439
But when they think of you, young mistress,

1178
01:18:33,520-->01:18:35,879
they will pass another sleepless night.

1179
01:18:41,200-->01:18:43,119
Hasn’t that wretched creature been caught yet?

1180
01:18:45,119-->01:18:46,999
I’ve tried my best.

1181
01:18:49,40-->01:18:53,40
It seems that even such trifles still require my personal attention.

1182
01:18:54,200-->01:18:56,800
- Zhuxi. - Your Highness.

1183
01:18:58,119-->01:19:0,999
- Is it ready? - Yes, Your Highness.

1184
01:19:22,40-->01:19:25,159
I have been suffering from eye problems, so you think I’m blind.

1185
01:19:26,600-->01:19:28,960
It’s fortunate that my mind is still clear.

1186
01:19:30,39-->01:19:33,960
That vile creature has killed my own grandson.

1187
01:19:37,279-->01:19:38,760
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

1188
01:19:38,840-->01:19:41,520
Lady Fucha has lost her baby. It is beyond repair.

1189
01:19:42,319-->01:19:46,840
But as for Lady Wan’s baby, no further mishaps are to happen.

1190
01:19:50,520-->01:19:53,600
Consort Hua!

1191
01:19:54,840-->01:19:56,880
My lady, Consort Duan has already retired for the night.

1192
01:19:56,959-->01:19:59,279
If you’d like to visit, please return tomorrow.

1193
01:20:0,639-->01:20:2,40
- Hold her. - Yes, my lady.

1194
01:20:2,520-->01:20:4,600
My lady.

1195
01:20:12,800-->01:20:14,160
It’s been so many years.

1196
01:20:15,199-->01:20:18,160
Whenever you lost your temper, you would burst into my palace

1197
01:20:19,119-->01:20:21,359
in exactly the same pose as now.

1198
01:20:21,439-->01:20:23,439
It’s been so many years.

1199
01:20:23,520-->01:20:26,39
Whenever I think of my unborn child,

1200
01:20:26,759-->01:20:29,80
I wish I could eat your flesh and drink your blood.

1201
01:20:30,479-->01:20:33,399
It was you who served me that medicinal tonic.

1202
01:20:33,999-->01:20:38,359
You were the most inoffensive concubine. That’s why I trusted you somehow.

1203
01:20:39,39-->01:20:41,880
I never imagined you could be so vicious.

1204
01:20:42,560-->01:20:45,600
How could you kill my baby like that?

1205
01:20:45,680-->01:20:47,279
If you had any solid evidence,

1206
01:20:48,840-->01:20:51,640
you should have ended my life in the most terrible fashion.

1207
01:20:53,159-->01:20:55,159
Why are you still standing there?

1208
01:20:57,319-->01:21:0,80
As long as you dwell in the palace,

1209
01:21:0,680-->01:21:3,359
I will never let you off.

1210
01:21:3,439-->01:21:5,279
I will watch you linger on to your last breath

1211
01:21:5,359-->01:21:7,79
and make your life a living hell.

1212
01:21:17,999-->01:21:19,600
How’s your wound?

1213
01:21:20,520-->01:21:21,720
It’s healing.

1214
01:21:24,720-->01:21:27,119
This healing balm is made from my family’s traditional recipe.

1215
01:21:27,759-->01:21:31,680
It contains peach blossom and pearl powder which can give you a rosy complexion.

1216
01:21:32,399-->01:21:35,320
The most valuable ingredient is the marrow of white otter.

1217
01:21:35,399-->01:21:37,879
It can erase the scar, leaving your skin as good as new.

1218
01:21:38,359-->01:21:40,640
It’s best to use it while it’s still fresh.

1219
01:21:40,720-->01:21:44,479
Otherwise, as it grows stale, it will lose its effect.

1220
01:21:44,560-->01:21:46,199
It smells good.

1221
01:21:46,279-->01:21:48,680
At first I wanted to use perfume to regulate the odor.

1222
01:21:48,760-->01:21:51,999
But I realized that you should avoid perfumes since you’re pregnant.

1223
01:21:52,79-->01:21:54,679
So I used fresh flowers to regulate the odor instead.

1224
01:21:54,759-->01:21:58,199
In this case, it doesn’t smell like an ointment.

1225
01:21:58,919-->01:22:2,560
You are so thoughtful. I don’t know how to show my gratitude.

1226
01:22:12,119-->01:22:14,239
I’ve already told the Empress.

1227
01:22:14,839-->01:22:18,719
On the day Consort Jing is conferred, you will be promoted to Concubine Wan.

1228
01:22:22,239-->01:22:24,39
Huan Huan, what do you think?

1229
01:22:27,280-->01:22:30,439
It looks softer, not as stiff as a normal floral ornament.

1230
01:22:31,199-->01:22:34,399
Imitating its beauty is enough. It need not be exactly the same.

1231
01:22:35,359-->01:22:39,399
We’ll call it “Lovely Pear Blossom Makeup.”

1232
01:22:40,920-->01:22:43,80
My dear, as you created it, you may name it.

1233
01:22:43,159-->01:22:45,399
It’s very elegant and refined.

1234
01:22:45,479-->01:22:48,880
I’m afraid the others will think you are partial to me.

1235
01:22:48,960-->01:22:52,359
I am clearly partial only to you. Does that displease you?

1236
01:22:54,239-->01:22:57,560
Mei has only just recovered. Your Majesty, you should visit her.

1237
01:22:58,159-->01:23:0,360
I just did.

1238
01:23:0,439-->01:23:3,199
I somehow sensed that she received me coldly.

1239
01:23:4,439-->01:23:8,439
Mei has been ill for so long. It’s no surprise that she is dispirited.

1240
01:23:9,239-->01:23:12,39
Your Majesty, if she has displeased you, please forgive her.

1241
01:23:14,0-->01:23:15,880
Speaking of the illness,

1242
01:23:15,960-->01:23:18,160
a vexing question remains in my mind.

1243
01:23:18,760-->01:23:21,320
Is it proper for you to share it with me?

1244
01:23:21,399-->01:23:24,279
The other day Consort Jing told me

1245
01:23:24,359-->01:23:28,80
that Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen have an effective treatment for the disease.

1246
01:23:28,919-->01:23:32,640
But they accept bribes in secret from many imperial maids and eunuchs.

1247
01:23:33,319-->01:23:35,79
They treat the powerful first

1248
01:23:35,159-->01:23:37,640
without even glancing at those of lower status.

1249
01:23:37,720-->01:23:41,39
They withhold the medicine and let them perish untreated.

1250
01:23:41,520-->01:23:45,560
But the epidemic has not abated. We must keep them alive.

1251
01:23:47,199-->01:23:52,439
I can recommend a doctor. He is able to treat the disease.

1252
01:23:52,520-->01:23:55,120
- Who? - Imperial Doctor Wen Shichu.

1253
01:23:56,159-->01:23:57,720
Why him?

1254
01:23:57,800-->01:24:1,39
When Doctor Wen treated Mei’s illness, she recovered effectively.

1255
01:24:1,119-->01:24:2,760
Besides, I have also heard

1256
01:24:2,840-->01:24:6,680
that Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen’s remedy was derived from Doctor Wen’s work.

1257
01:24:6,760-->01:24:9,720
Your Majesty, if you don’t believe me, you may look into it.

1258
01:24:9,800-->01:24:13,680
Those who were treated by Doctor Wen recovered in a shorter time

1259
01:24:13,760-->01:24:16,39
and had no residual problems, like nausea or weakness.

1260
01:24:16,119-->01:24:19,600
What Doctor Jiang used was an old prescription drawn up by Doctor Wen.

1261
01:24:19,680-->01:24:21,560
The side effects were stronger.

1262
01:24:23,439-->01:24:25,39
I see.

1263
01:24:27,119-->01:24:30,119
After all, those two men work for Consort Hua.

1264
01:24:30,720-->01:24:34,159
But if I wish to remove them, there are many ways to do so.

1265
01:24:38,560-->01:24:41,959
Very well. Let’s change the subject.

1266
01:24:42,920-->01:24:44,919
April 17th is your birthday.

1267
01:24:45,0-->01:24:46,960
Moreover, you’re expecting.

1268
01:24:47,40-->01:24:51,159
I will order the Imperial Household Department to hold a celebration.

1269
01:24:51,239-->01:24:53,159
It is your decision, Your Majesty.

1270
01:24:53,239-->01:24:55,159
Good, leave it to me.

1271
01:24:55,239-->01:24:58,0
So long as it pleases you and the baby.

1272
01:24:58,80-->01:25:0,0
Your Majesty, you are very fond of children.

1273
01:25:0,80-->01:25:2,40
And you meet with Consort Hua quite often.

1274
01:25:2,119-->01:25:4,560
How is it that Consort Hua has not yet conceived a child?

1275
01:25:4,640-->01:25:6,520
She never will.

1276
01:25:9,0-->01:25:11,680
I understand that Consort Hua had a miscarriage before.

1277
01:25:11,759-->01:25:13,760
Did it cause a complication?

1278
01:25:31,399-->01:25:32,680
My lady.

1279
01:25:33,279-->01:25:36,640
The two Doctor Jiangs came to check on you.

1280
01:25:37,239-->01:25:41,280
But they left when they learned that His Majesty was coming to dine.

1281
01:25:41,880-->01:25:44,600
They said they would return in the evening.

1282
01:25:46,119-->01:25:47,359
By the way,

1283
01:25:48,160-->01:25:50,359
that pregnant woman at Suiyu Pavilion is unable to serve in bed.

1284
01:25:50,439-->01:25:52,199
Yet His Majesty visits her frequently.

1285
01:25:52,840-->01:25:55,359
Tell Doctor Jiang to remind His Majesty that he should avoid going there.

1286
01:25:58,720-->01:26:0,39
Xia Yi.

1287
01:26:1,359-->01:26:2,999
I wish to remove two men.

1288
01:26:3,479-->01:26:5,199
I await your orders.

1289
01:26:5,279-->01:26:7,640
Do it secretly and do not arouse suspicion.

1290
01:26:7,720-->01:26:8,800
XIA YI

1291
01:26:8,879-->01:26:10,759
As you wish, Your Majesty.

1292
01:26:14,399-->01:26:15,439
Your Majesty.

1293
01:26:15,520-->01:26:18,999
Jiang Cheng and Jiang Shen were killed by robbers on their way home last night.

1294
01:26:19,79-->01:26:21,79
Their heads are not to be found.

1295
01:26:21,159-->01:26:22,879
In the capital city, at the Emperor’s feet,

1296
01:26:22,959-->01:26:24,399
how can such a murder happen?

1297
01:26:24,479-->01:26:26,80
It’s outrageous!

1298
01:26:27,119-->01:26:28,720
My beloved concubine,

1299
01:26:29,439-->01:26:32,560
I was shocked to hear of this grievous event.

1300
01:26:32,640-->01:26:35,760
I’ve ordered an investigation. You may rest easy.

1301
01:26:36,920-->01:26:40,0
But with those two imperial doctors dead, the treatment of the epidemic–

1302
01:26:40,79-->01:26:41,839
You need not worry.

1303
01:26:45,600-->01:26:46,640
Here.

1304
01:26:46,719-->01:26:48,719
Throw more fish food here.

1305
01:26:48,799-->01:26:50,520
Don’t let some overeat while others starve to death.

1306
01:26:50,600-->01:26:53,760
- Over there. - Eunuch Yun. The fish here are well-fed.

1307
01:26:54,840-->01:26:57,560
Well-fed? Of course.

1308
01:26:58,159-->01:27:3,359
In those years, Consort Hua wished she could feed her enemies to the fish.

1309
01:27:4,79-->01:27:7,399
However, I do not believe Consort Hua was born like that.

1310
01:27:7,479-->01:27:13,119
Her behavior grew outrageous over time, for two reasons alone.

1311
01:27:13,199-->01:27:17,40
Having lost her own, she could not bear to see any other raise a child.

1312
01:27:17,119-->01:27:21,320
Loving the Emperor, she could not bear to see any other win his favor.

1313
01:27:21,399-->01:27:26,479
She was arrogant and capricious because she enjoyed the Emperor’s favor.

1314
01:27:26,560-->01:27:30,800
If not for her, I would not have lost my first imperial son.

1315
01:27:31,399-->01:27:34,640
Everyone in the harem feared her and hated her

1316
01:27:34,720-->01:27:38,120
but secretly hoped one day to become just like her.

1317
01:27:38,560-->01:27:41,280
Empress Dowager, aren’t you tired?

1318
01:27:41,359-->01:27:44,119
Let me help you walk to the pavilion for some rest.

1319
01:27:45,479-->01:27:46,880
Let us go.
