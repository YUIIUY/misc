1
00:02:13,199-->00:02:15,360
Lingrong used to sing so well,

2
00:02:15,440-->00:02:19,560
her voice sonorous and resounding.

3
00:02:20,560-->00:02:23,0
Ever since her voice grew hoarse,

4
00:02:23,80-->00:02:26,800
she struggled to devise a way, planning to use ice dancing

5
00:02:26,879-->00:02:29,800
to win His Majesty's favor.

6
00:02:29,879-->00:02:32,80
Lingrong appeared meek and mild,

7
00:02:32,160-->00:02:35,599
but deep down, she was cold and cruel.

8
00:02:35,680-->00:02:40,199
She sent me the healing balm knowing full well that it was poisonous.

9
00:02:40,280-->00:02:43,119
She resented me, and all the others,

10
00:02:43,199-->00:02:45,960
believing that she had been exploited.

11
00:02:46,759-->00:02:48,520
Human nature is unfathomable.

12
00:02:48,600-->00:02:53,719
We were once like sisters to one another, but ended up as enemies.

13
00:02:59,240-->00:03:02,160
These congratulatory gifts are almost identical.

14
00:03:02,240-->00:03:04,639
Set aside the ordinary gifts to bestow upon others.

15
00:03:04,719-->00:03:08,800
Most are forgettable, except for this coral bracelet from Marquess Guo.

16
00:03:08,880-->00:03:11,759
It is of exquisite craftsmanship.

17
00:03:17,759-->00:03:19,960
"The coral in my palm I may not keep,

18
00:03:20,560-->00:03:22,919
for it has become the flower of the royal palace."

19
00:03:27,80-->00:03:29,839
Mei is unwell. We shall visit her.

20
00:03:35,879-->00:03:37,280
I wish you good fortune, Noble Consort Xi.

21
00:03:37,360-->00:03:38,520
Halt.

22
00:03:45,39-->00:03:48,319
You must be in high spirits to take a stroll, Lady Ning.

23
00:03:48,399-->00:03:50,799
I am merely wandering about.

24
00:03:50,879-->00:03:52,719
I shall soon return and rest with Tuanrong.

25
00:03:52,800-->00:03:55,280
Your cat, Tuanrong, is very lovely.

26
00:03:55,639-->00:03:57,280
Has she grown bigger?

27
00:03:57,360-->00:04:01,360
If you are curious, my lady, please come to Chunxi Hall now.

28
00:04:01,440-->00:04:04,240
Yet you are always followed by so many servants.

29
00:04:04,959-->00:04:08,120
Tuanrong may be too frightened to call out.

30
00:04:08,200-->00:04:12,639
My lady, you do know Tuanrong's call is truly alluring.

31
00:04:14,119-->00:04:15,999
On such a beautiful night,

32
00:04:16,79-->00:04:19,320
we shall take a stroll together while the mood inspires us.

33
00:04:24,799-->00:04:26,839
I accept your invitation

34
00:04:26,920-->00:04:30,320
and shall visit your residence.

35
00:04:31,279-->00:04:33,40
Do not follow us.

36
00:04:40,159-->00:04:41,839
What are you doing?

37
00:04:41,920-->00:04:44,480
My lady, do not disdain this dagger.

38
00:04:44,559-->00:04:47,600
I was once hurt by a foolish leopard.

39
00:04:47,680-->00:04:52,560
I later stole into the leopard garden and slit its throat.

40
00:04:52,640-->00:04:54,839
Huanbi, if you cry out,

41
00:04:55,720-->00:05:00,559
I might slit her throat by accident.

42
00:05:00,639-->00:05:05,879
You don't need to frighten Huanbi. You've resented me for long, haven't you?

43
00:05:07,359-->00:05:10,920
Otherwise, you would not have had Tuanrong call out for all of those cats,

44
00:05:11,0-->00:05:13,79
hoping to kill me along with my unborn child.

45
00:05:14,160-->00:05:16,519
You knew it all along,

46
00:05:17,439-->00:05:19,439
yet you have long tolerated me calmly.

47
00:05:20,560-->00:05:23,640
I do not wish to assail you for your mad love.

48
00:05:24,560-->00:05:26,480
You are now His Majesty's favorite.

49
00:05:27,239-->00:05:29,679
It is not worth killing me

50
00:05:30,600-->00:05:32,600
over Marquess Guo.

51
00:05:33,639-->00:05:35,240
You knew.

52
00:05:35,320-->00:05:38,40
You cherish silk tree flowers above your own health.

53
00:05:38,799-->00:05:40,560
Besides, I was told

54
00:05:41,480-->00:05:43,440
that Marquess Guo sent for an imperial doctor

55
00:05:43,520-->00:05:45,960
to rescue you from death.

56
00:05:47,479-->00:05:51,959
But what would he think if he learned that he had saved a wicked soul?

57
00:05:53,279-->00:05:56,679
His Lordship was kind to save you, but you are vicious and cruel.

58
00:05:56,759-->00:05:58,199
You don't deserve to harbor feelings for him.

59
00:05:58,399-->00:06:01,959
You remained silent when you heard I had harmed your mistress,

60
00:06:02,279-->00:06:04,480
yet the mere mention of His Lordship arouses your anger.

61
00:06:04,559-->00:06:05,760
You–

62
00:06:06,319-->00:06:07,560
You fiend.

63
00:06:07,839-->00:06:12,199
If I am a fiend, then Noble Consort Xi is foremost among all fiends.

64
00:06:13,440-->00:06:15,39
You found love in Ganlu Temple,

65
00:06:15,119-->00:06:18,919
but you showed insatiable desire and seduced His Majesty once again.

66
00:06:18,999-->00:06:20,720
The Marquess Guo that I know

67
00:06:20,800-->00:06:24,40
is the bravest and the most gallant man in the world.

68
00:06:24,640-->00:06:27,560
I have never seen him so frustrated and weary.

69
00:06:29,160-->00:06:33,439
When you returned to the palace, my suspicions were aroused,

70
00:06:34,559-->00:06:36,639
but they were confirmed at the mid-autumn family feast.

71
00:06:36,720-->00:06:39,360
- It was you eavesdropping. - What is it to you?

72
00:06:40,80-->00:06:42,399
You think I don't deserve to have feelings for His Lordship.

73
00:06:43,79-->00:06:44,920
But you are even less worthy.

74
00:06:45,639-->00:06:47,279
You have no idea.

75
00:06:48,800-->00:06:52,280
It is so much harder to betray the one you love.

76
00:06:54,920-->00:06:57,79
Where did you get this? This coral bracelet

77
00:06:57,160-->00:06:58,520
is His Lordship's favorite treasure

78
00:06:58,600-->00:07:01,360
which he obtained in the Nan Hai Sea some years ago.

79
00:07:01,440-->00:07:04,399
He has never shown it to anyone. What are you doing with it?

80
00:07:04,480-->00:07:07,519
You should ask its owner.

81
00:07:10,640-->00:07:13,839
His Lordship owes you nothing.

82
00:07:13,920-->00:07:16,240
Why can't he forget you?

83
00:07:19,79-->00:07:20,519
So be it.

84
00:07:21,160-->00:07:23,600
His Lordship loves you, heart and soul.

85
00:07:23,680-->00:07:27,679
If you have any feeling left at all, it shall weigh on your conscience forever.

86
00:07:28,959-->00:07:31,440
The bit of kindness His Lordship has shown me

87
00:07:31,519-->00:07:35,120
may well mean nothing to you.

88
00:07:36,560-->00:07:40,879
But for me, it is a warmth found but once in a lifetime.

89
00:07:46,839-->00:07:49,240
- What a lunatic! - Let her be.

90
00:07:50,839-->00:07:55,519
Lady Ning is of a passionate nature.

91
00:08:02,480-->00:08:03,519
Look, my lady!

92
00:08:03,680-->00:08:05,279
- Sister Huan! - Yurao!

93
00:08:05,360-->00:08:07,600
- Miss Yurao. - Greetings, my lady.

94
00:08:07,680-->00:08:11,0
Yurao, let me see your face.

95
00:08:11,80-->00:08:12,480
YURAO

96
00:08:12,560-->00:08:16,79
It's a joy to reunite after years apart. Why the tears, Sister Huan?

97
00:08:17,959-->00:08:22,639
His Majesty is delighted with the twins, so your family has been invited to visit.

98
00:08:22,720-->00:08:24,160
His Majesty also said

99
00:08:24,239-->00:08:28,839
that Miss Yurao can settle in the palace to keep you company.

100
00:08:28,920-->00:08:31,959
I don't see my parents. Are they here, too?

101
00:08:32,39-->00:08:34,320
Justice Zhen is still recovering from his illness.

102
00:08:34,399-->00:08:36,320
His Majesty has summoned your mother to the palace.

103
00:08:36,399-->00:08:41,0
To ease your mind, my lady, Miss Yurao rushed here to visit you.

104
00:08:41,80-->00:08:45,880
You shall meet your parents in the palace shortly, my lady.

105
00:08:50,360-->00:08:52,39
The Imperial Medical Bureau has made

106
00:08:52,119-->00:08:53,719
this slimming balm for you, young mistress.

107
00:08:53,799-->00:08:57,719
Despite reducing your weight, your body should remain firm.

108
00:08:57,799-->00:08:59,519
Apply more on my waist.

109
00:09:01,80-->00:09:02,799
Young mistress, it is done.

110
00:09:04,919-->00:09:07,839
Baoque, help me–

111
00:09:08,840-->00:09:11,840
Young mistress, are you all right?

112
00:09:11,919-->00:09:13,759
Young mistress! Young mistress!

113
00:09:14,279-->00:09:16,80
Concubine An collapsed at Yanxi Palace.

114
00:09:16,519-->00:09:18,279
Has the imperial doctor attended to her?

115
00:09:18,360-->00:09:19,440
Yes, my lady.

116
00:09:19,519-->00:09:22,440
But Concubine An refused to have the imperial doctor examine her.

117
00:09:23,759-->00:09:26,520
The maid who sent for the doctor

118
00:09:26,600-->00:09:29,440
said Concubine An collapsed from being on a strict regimen.

119
00:09:29,519-->00:09:31,400
Her diet, for what?

120
00:09:31,479-->00:09:33,639
Since she fell out of favor,

121
00:09:33,720-->00:09:37,559
it is said she secretly practices for the ice festival every day.

122
00:09:38,399-->00:09:41,960
All the Emperors of our dynasty have had high regard for the ice games,

123
00:09:42,40-->00:09:44,359
so an ice festival is held every year.

124
00:09:44,440-->00:09:47,679
An Lingrong is quite clever to strive for His Majesty's favor in this way.

125
00:09:48,600-->00:09:51,440
The ice games must be practiced from childhood.

126
00:09:52,39-->00:09:53,799
As for the ice dance,

127
00:09:53,879-->00:09:57,159
dancers are required to be lithe and flexible,

128
00:09:57,240-->00:09:59,920
not skills to be acquired in a short span of time.

129
00:10:00,0-->00:10:02,80
But I know of a way to obtain immediate results.

130
00:10:03,639-->00:10:06,399
In the Han Dynasty, Zhao Feiyan found favor with Emperor Cheng.

131
00:10:06,480-->00:10:11,0
She was a slender and agile dancer, for she used a weight reducing treatment.

132
00:10:12,320-->00:10:15,919
Pressed into the navel, a substance is absorbed into the flesh

133
00:10:16,0-->00:10:18,999
that whitens the skin and wards off weight.

134
00:10:19,80-->00:10:21,759
The complexion is brightened.

135
00:10:23,159-->00:10:26,759
However, it contains musk.

136
00:10:27,960-->00:10:32,39
I have heard that a bath of azalea flower infusion

137
00:10:32,120-->00:10:34,200
can serve as an antidote to the musk toxins.

138
00:10:35,200-->00:10:37,39
If that were true,

139
00:10:37,639-->00:10:41,39
the Zhao sisters, Feiyan and Hede, having such great power,

140
00:10:41,120-->00:10:44,519
would have conceived children after using up all the azalea flowers.

141
00:10:45,440-->00:10:47,39
If Concubine An is told of this,

142
00:10:47,120-->00:10:49,480
she will treat it as an invaluable treasure.

143
00:10:50,600-->00:10:55,400
The treatment is truly effective. You have lost much weight, my lady.

144
00:10:55,879-->00:11:00,79
But its effect is far too potent. I am worried–

145
00:11:00,159-->00:11:01,999
It is of no concern.

146
00:11:02,640-->00:11:04,239
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

147
00:11:05,240-->00:11:08,240
I know the amount of musk contained in it.

148
00:11:09,0-->00:11:12,679
Please bathe in the azalea flower infusion, my lady.

149
00:11:12,760-->00:11:16,240
In any case, I have consumed many different medicines all these years.

150
00:11:16,320-->00:11:18,440
Whether I take such a bath or not makes little difference.

151
00:11:47,80-->00:11:49,480
The ice festival of last year was spectacular.

152
00:11:49,559-->00:11:53,519
I greatly admired the performance of "Nezha and the Dragon King."

153
00:11:53,600-->00:11:56,0
The Taizu Emperor was adept at skating.

154
00:11:56,80-->00:11:59,879
When he led his skating team, they were even faster than horses.

155
00:12:00,559-->00:12:04,80
I was told that when Your Majesty was the Fourth Prince,

156
00:12:04,159-->00:12:07,200
you always triumphed in the competition of mounted archery on ice.

157
00:12:50,440-->00:12:52,80
Concubine An.

158
00:13:48,80-->00:13:50,39
May blessings be with you, Your Majesty.

159
00:13:57,639-->00:14:00,679
It's freezing. Take care lest you fall ill.

160
00:14:00,759-->00:14:05,760
Concubine An may aptly be given the name "Flying Swallow of the Ice."

161
00:14:05,839-->00:14:10,559
It recalls the "Flying Wild Goose" danced by Noble Consort Xi.

162
00:14:10,640-->00:14:13,279
They are both as graceful as sprites.

163
00:14:13,360-->00:14:15,679
I dare not compare myself to Noble Consort Xi,

164
00:14:16,279-->00:14:18,200
for I merely follow her example.

165
00:14:18,279-->00:14:22,240
Very well then. We shall spend the New Year together.

166
00:14:22,320-->00:14:24,600
As you wish, Your Majesty.

167
00:14:25,279-->00:14:31,720
Lotus blossoms abound to be picked to the south of the Yangtze

168
00:14:33,80-->00:14:35,39
Fields of lotus leaves...

169
00:14:48,960-->00:14:50,559
Baoque.

170
00:14:55,719-->00:14:58,599
- Empty this censer. - Yes, my lady.

171
00:15:06,720-->00:15:08,919
How is Mei progressing?

172
00:15:09,0-->00:15:11,559
In less than a fortnight, Concubine Hui will be in labor.

173
00:15:11,639-->00:15:14,840
She has been well nourished and her condition is stable.

174
00:15:16,320-->00:15:18,999
Every time, you say the same words.

175
00:15:19,80-->00:15:21,919
But the more I hear them, the more it puts me at ease.

176
00:15:22,559-->00:15:23,600
Sister Huan.

177
00:15:31,400-->00:15:33,720
Miss Yurao, you run fast. Please mind your step.

178
00:15:33,799-->00:15:36,640
Jinxi will take care of me here. You may leave now.

179
00:15:36,720-->00:15:37,720
Yes, Miss Yurao.

180
00:15:37,799-->00:15:41,320
Xiao Yunzi is flying a kite with Hongyan. Would you like to see? It must be fun.

181
00:15:41,399-->00:15:42,879
No, you may go on your own.

182
00:15:47,519-->00:15:49,959
I bow before Noble Consort Xi.

183
00:15:50,39-->00:15:51,320
You may rise.

184
00:15:52,759-->00:15:56,520
The Empress requests your presence in Jingren Palace at once.

185
00:15:56,600-->00:15:58,320
What is it?

186
00:15:58,399-->00:16:00,720
JINGREN PALACE

187
00:16:02,399-->00:16:05,840
Lady Qi, you insist on making an accusation against Noble Consort Xi

188
00:16:05,919-->00:16:08,200
and request the presence of all concubines of the Imperial Harem.

189
00:16:08,279-->00:16:10,0
State your accusation.

190
00:16:12,199-->00:16:13,840
I accuse Noble Consort Xi of infidelity,

191
00:16:13,919-->00:16:16,600
a stain upon the Imperial Palace not even death can atone for.

192
00:16:16,679-->00:16:20,39
Palace custom is strict! Lady Qi, do not spout nonsense!

193
00:16:20,760-->00:16:22,559
I swear by my Guwalgiya clan.

194
00:16:22,639-->00:16:26,440
If any part of what I say is false, may my clan perish, leaving no progeny.

195
00:16:27,440-->00:16:30,839
Since you accuse her of infidelity, tell me who the adulterer is.

196
00:16:32,120-->00:16:33,680
Doctor Wen Shichu.

197
00:16:37,479-->00:16:41,319
Wen Shichu is a trusted personal doctor. He takes her pulse daily.

198
00:16:41,400-->00:16:44,520
It is no surprise if proximity breeds fondness.

199
00:16:45,159-->00:16:47,439
What both of you have said is pure conjecture.

200
00:16:47,519-->00:16:50,359
It is reasonable for Doctor Wen

201
00:16:50,440-->00:16:52,919
to treat Noble Consort Xi when she falls ill.

202
00:16:52,999-->00:16:56,520
Moreover, Doctor Wen has long been close to her maternal family.

203
00:16:56,600-->00:16:59,840
It is fitting that they look after one another in the palace.

204
00:17:00,720-->00:17:03,0
How could this be considered infidelity?

205
00:17:03,80-->00:17:06,39
In other words, they were childhood playmates.

206
00:17:06,119-->00:17:09,839
You are spouting nonsense. Do you have any proof?

207
00:17:09,919-->00:17:11,679
Yes, of course.

208
00:17:11,760-->00:17:15,400
Before Noble Consort Xi was selected for service, Doctor Wen proposed to her.

209
00:17:19,200-->00:17:22,880
- I bow before Your Highness. - Raise your head and speak.

210
00:17:25,880-->00:17:28,79
Bin-er?

211
00:17:28,920-->00:17:29,959
It's you.

212
00:17:30,40-->00:17:32,439
You do recognize her, Noble Consort Xi.

213
00:17:32,519-->00:17:35,119
She married Chen Si, a servant of my family.

214
00:17:35,199-->00:17:36,520
She previously served the Zhen family.

215
00:17:37,160-->00:17:40,79
I ask only one question. When you served the Zhen family,

216
00:17:40,720-->00:17:43,359
did Wen Shichu ask for the hand of Zhen Huan,

217
00:17:43,440-->00:17:46,880
who you see before you now as Noble Consort Xi?

218
00:17:50,199-->00:17:53,719
Speak aloud before the Empress! Has Chen Si taught you no manners?

219
00:17:53,799-->00:17:57,920
A fortnight before the auditions, Doctor Wen did propose marriage.

220
00:17:58,880-->00:18:00,440
However,

221
00:18:01,400-->00:18:04,160
he did not propose formally...

222
00:18:06,640-->00:18:10,320
but in private with Noble Consort Xi.

223
00:18:11,880-->00:18:15,319
- Did Noble Consort Xi accept? - No, no, she–

224
00:18:17,800-->00:18:21,839
If Noble Consort Xi and Doctor Wen were truly in love,

225
00:18:21,920-->00:18:24,319
they would not be here at present.

226
00:18:25,0-->00:18:27,599
Their presence means that Noble Consort Xi has nothing to hide

227
00:18:27,680-->00:18:30,200
regarding her friendship with Doctor Wen.

228
00:18:30,799-->00:18:34,40
Lady Qi, if it were true

229
00:18:34,119-->00:18:37,119
that Noble Consort Xi and Doctor Wen had a love affair,

230
00:18:37,200-->00:18:39,680
they would take great pains to conceal it.

231
00:18:39,759-->00:18:43,599
The best way to conceal a misdeed is not to commit one in the first place.

232
00:18:43,680-->00:18:46,799
But if you do commit one, someday it will reveal itself.

233
00:18:46,880-->00:18:49,640
Feiwen of Yongshou Palace has witnessed this several times.

234
00:18:49,720-->00:18:54,800
Feiwen, when was this? What did you observe?

235
00:18:54,880-->00:18:57,799
Tell me everything exactly as it happened.

236
00:18:59,480-->00:19:02,959
One day, Noble Consort Xi was talking with Doctor Wen.

237
00:19:03,39-->00:19:04,799
Few servants were there.

238
00:19:04,880-->00:19:07,240
I went in with Miss Yurao,

239
00:19:07,319-->00:19:10,400
and then I saw

240
00:19:10,480-->00:19:12,960
Doctor Wen was touching her hand.

241
00:19:13,39-->00:19:16,480
They were sitting still, their gaze fixed upon each other.

242
00:19:17,599-->00:19:21,280
Doctor Wen drew back his hand as soon as he saw us.

243
00:19:22,160-->00:19:26,520
The cuff of his robe was exposed, which goes against decency.

244
00:19:26,599-->00:19:28,960
It was embroidered with five bamboo leaves.

245
00:19:29,480-->00:19:31,640
Thinking it over afterwards,

246
00:19:31,719-->00:19:34,999
I feared Noble Consort Xi would kill me if she knew what I had seen.

247
00:19:35,80-->00:19:37,559
Therefore, I begged Lady Qi to save me.

248
00:19:38,279-->00:19:40,759
An insignificant maid has already seen quite a lot.

249
00:19:41,520-->00:19:45,880
But when none is watching, there must be further misdeeds.

250
00:19:45,960-->00:19:47,720
This could have serious consequences.

251
00:19:48,239-->00:19:51,119
Bring Doctor Wen here for questioning.

252
00:19:57,519-->00:20:00,519
I bow before Your Highness and all the young mistresses.

253
00:20:00,599-->00:20:01,839
You may rise.

254
00:20:04,40-->00:20:06,280
Doctor Wen, excuse me.

255
00:20:12,999-->00:20:16,799
This embroidery is unique. Do you always wear it on your cuff?

256
00:20:18,200-->00:20:20,919
Your Highness, my mother is fond of bamboo,

257
00:20:21,0-->00:20:25,400
so she embroiders bamboo leaves on my cuff to remind me of my family.

258
00:20:26,0-->00:20:27,599
Your Highness,

259
00:20:27,680-->00:20:33,559
the embroidery on his cuff is nothing new.

260
00:20:33,640-->00:20:37,319
If one pays attention, it will be noticed.

261
00:20:37,400-->00:20:40,559
It means nothing.

262
00:20:40,640-->00:20:45,0
How strange for an imperial doctor to speak face-to-face with a Noble Consort,

263
00:20:45,79-->00:20:48,160
his cuffs rolled up as if he were at home.

264
00:20:48,239-->00:20:51,319
In the future, imperial doctors may enter a Noble Consort's palace,

265
00:20:51,400-->00:20:53,920
rolling up their cuffs or taking off their clothes,

266
00:20:53,999-->00:20:55,640
in fact, doing anything they wish.

267
00:20:58,800-->00:21:03,359
Noble Consort Xi summoned me to inquire after the health of Concubine Hui.

268
00:21:03,440-->00:21:07,240
Pleased to learn that Concubine Hui was well, she offered me some tea.

269
00:21:07,319-->00:21:11,0
I rolled up my sleeves while drinking tea.

270
00:21:11,79-->00:21:13,79
I was at fault for my lack of manners.

271
00:21:13,160-->00:21:17,280
If Noble Consort Xi had any respect for the other imperial doctors,

272
00:21:17,959-->00:21:22,160
she would not have entrusted you with attending to her best friend.

273
00:21:22,240-->00:21:26,319
The relationship between you two is nothing ordinary indeed.

274
00:21:26,400-->00:21:27,599
Young mistress, you–

275
00:21:31,79-->00:21:34,160
Feiwen, you have served me for some time,

276
00:21:34,240-->00:21:37,160
but I did not know you had such a mind.

277
00:21:37,799-->00:21:41,599
I shall be loyal to His Majesty only.

278
00:21:41,679-->00:21:44,439
If you are offended, please forgive me, my lady.

279
00:21:44,520-->00:21:47,839
Were I to be offended by your loyalty to His Majesty,

280
00:21:48,440-->00:21:51,640
would I not be considered unfaithful and unrighteous?

281
00:21:55,119-->00:21:58,200
Allow me to ask her a few questions, Your Highness.

282
00:22:03,39-->00:22:06,400
Feiwen, as my maid,

283
00:22:07,79-->00:22:09,880
you've come here to disclose my private affairs.

284
00:22:09,960-->00:22:13,680
You do know this marks the end of your service, don't you?

285
00:22:13,759-->00:22:15,960
I hope you have performed your duties.

286
00:22:18,0-->00:22:20,199
Tell me.

287
00:22:20,280-->00:22:22,119
Before coming here,

288
00:22:22,200-->00:22:25,680
did you wipe the colored glass vase on the padauk table in the main hall?

289
00:22:26,520-->00:22:27,560
Yes, I wiped it clean.

290
00:22:29,880-->00:22:31,39
Nonsense!

291
00:22:31,760-->00:22:35,119
On the padauk table, there is no colored glass vase,

292
00:22:35,199-->00:22:36,640
but a green jade one.

293
00:22:37,839-->00:22:41,119
I was mistaken. It is a green jade vase indeed.

294
00:22:41,200-->00:22:45,40
No colored glass vase has ever been on the padauk table in the main hall.

295
00:22:47,0-->00:22:50,280
You have never invested the least effort into serving me.

296
00:22:50,359-->00:22:54,80
Rather, you note details like an imperial doctor touching my hand,

297
00:22:54,160-->00:22:57,400
or the embroidery on his cuff.

298
00:22:58,480-->00:23:02,920
Others would not dare observe such things.

299
00:23:03,720-->00:23:06,720
Why do you focus on such details?

300
00:23:06,799-->00:23:09,880
Your motives are quite suspicious.

301
00:23:10,480-->00:23:15,359
I have been too preoccupied with this matter to pay attention to trivialities.

302
00:23:16,119-->00:23:21,319
Were Doctor Wen and Noble Consort Xi to have a love affair,

303
00:23:21,400-->00:23:24,640
they would remain vigilant.

304
00:23:24,719-->00:23:28,960
If that were the case, how could Feiwen witness such details?

305
00:23:29,759-->00:23:35,480
Is it not possible that Feiwen snatches up every word and deed of her mistress?

306
00:23:35,559-->00:23:38,479
His Majesty the Emperor!

307
00:23:43,640-->00:23:46,640
May blessings and peace be with you, Your Majesty.

308
00:23:49,560-->00:23:54,359
How can I have peace when there is none in the Imperial Harem?

309
00:23:54,440-->00:23:58,759
Please forgive us for disturbing you, Your Majesty.

310
00:23:58,839-->00:24:02,359
Tell me what the commotion is about.

311
00:24:05,199-->00:24:08,359
I accuse Noble Consort Xi of infidelity, staining the Imperial Harem.

312
00:24:14,799-->00:24:16,440
Nonsense, you wretch!

313
00:24:16,519-->00:24:19,319
I swear on my life that I have told the truth.

314
00:24:19,880-->00:24:24,680
Lady Qi swore a solemn oath before us all. She may have some secrets to reveal.

315
00:24:24,759-->00:24:27,799
If it is merely a misunderstanding, it is better to investigate at once.

316
00:24:27,880-->00:24:31,519
If rumors spread, the reputation of Noble Consort Xi will be ruined.

317
00:24:32,480-->00:24:35,39
Very well. You may speak.

318
00:24:35,800-->00:24:38,799
If any of it should prove false, you will not be spared.

319
00:24:38,880-->00:24:42,480
Your Majesty, I can prove the love affair between Noble Consort Xi and Doctor Wen.

320
00:24:42,560-->00:24:45,960
After Noble Consort Xi left the palace, Doctor Wen often visited her,

321
00:24:46,39-->00:24:47,839
sharing the same room in Ganlu Temple.

322
00:24:47,920-->00:24:50,719
If you do not believe me, you can question one of the nuns.

323
00:24:50,800-->00:24:53,119
She is here in the palace at present.

324
00:24:57,519-->00:25:00,200
I am Jingbai of Ganlu Temple.

325
00:25:00,279-->00:25:02,0
I bow before Your Majesty and Your Highness.

326
00:25:02,79-->00:25:05,760
Please say what you must. We do not wish to disturb your devotions.

327
00:25:05,839-->00:25:06,839
Yes, my lady.

328
00:25:08,79-->00:25:11,880
Noble Consort Xi ignored us while at Ganlu Temple.

329
00:25:11,960-->00:25:16,400
We had no choice but to keep a respectful distance from her.

330
00:25:16,480-->00:25:21,359
At that time, Doctor Wen often visited her.

331
00:25:21,439-->00:25:24,640
Sometimes when I passed by her residence,

332
00:25:24,719-->00:25:28,119
the door was closed even in the daytime

333
00:25:28,200-->00:25:31,79
with both maids keeping watch at the door.

334
00:25:31,160-->00:25:36,200
I found it inappropriate and wished to alert her,

335
00:25:36,280-->00:25:39,480
but was scolded.

336
00:25:39,559-->00:25:42,160
Therefore, I spoke of it no more.

337
00:25:42,799-->00:25:45,440
After that, she feigned illness and moved away from Ganlu Temple

338
00:25:45,519-->00:25:48,400
as rumors had become widespread.

339
00:25:48,479-->00:25:50,599
She moved to Mount Lingyun with her two maids.

340
00:25:51,559-->00:25:53,920
It is unknown

341
00:25:53,999-->00:25:56,720
whether she and Wen maintained further contact or not.

342
00:25:56,799-->00:26:00,679
Is the Doctor Wen you mention here in the hall now?

343
00:26:03,119-->00:26:07,799
Buddha be trusted, it is he.

344
00:26:12,839-->00:26:16,839
Your Majesty, I have a headache. I would like to return and rest.

345
00:26:22,440-->00:26:24,839
Your Majesty, Noble Consort Xi has given birth to your offspring

346
00:26:24,919-->00:26:27,79
and manages affairs of the Imperial Harem.

347
00:26:27,680-->00:26:29,920
She may not claim credit, but she has rendered great service.

348
00:26:30,0-->00:26:32,79
A thorough investigation is needed, Your Majesty,

349
00:26:32,680-->00:26:36,400
so that Noble Consort Xi may be spared from rumors.

350
00:26:37,799-->00:26:40,839
Noble Consort Xi returned to the palace with a child conceived while away.

351
00:26:40,920-->00:26:43,39
His Majesty did not visit her often.

352
00:26:43,119-->00:26:46,319
If Jingbai is telling the truth, Doctor Wen was her most frequent visitor.

353
00:26:46,400-->00:26:48,440
Therefore, the children of Noble Consort Xi–

354
00:26:48,520-->00:26:52,479
Lady Qi, you are suggesting they are not His Majesty's offspring.

355
00:26:52,559-->00:26:56,159
For the sake of the empire, you must not make dangerous conjectures.

356
00:26:56,240-->00:27:00,79
Your Majesty, please pay no heed to her!

357
00:27:01,160-->00:27:04,560
Noble Consort Xi returned with her suspicious pregnancy.

358
00:27:04,640-->00:27:08,79
Only Jinxi and Huanbi were serving her at that moment.

359
00:27:08,160-->00:27:11,400
I daresay the truth will emerge through excruciating torture.

360
00:27:11,479-->00:27:12,880
How dare you!

361
00:27:12,960-->00:27:14,880
Only injustice will be obtained through torture.

362
00:27:14,959-->00:27:17,160
Torture should not be misused to force a confession.

363
00:27:17,239-->00:27:18,759
Your Majesty and Your Highness,

364
00:27:18,840-->00:27:21,439
torturing Jinxi and Huanbi is the sole way to uncover the truth.

365
00:27:21,520-->00:27:24,680
Otherwise, Noble Consort Xi and Doctor Wen might be wronged.

366
00:27:24,759-->00:27:27,400
These lowly maids will never confess without the use of torture.

367
00:27:27,480-->00:27:30,760
If they can endure all 72 techniques of the Office of Punishment

368
00:27:30,839-->00:27:32,759
without changing their story, it might be credible.

369
00:27:32,839-->00:27:38,560
Even if they survive the torture, they will be maimed.

370
00:27:38,640-->00:27:41,479
What use is it to prove their innocence in this way?

371
00:27:46,400-->00:27:48,239
Your Majesty, to prove my mistress's innocence,

372
00:27:48,320-->00:27:50,680
I am prepared to endure any trials.

373
00:27:50,760-->00:27:55,599
Noble Consort Xi, I know you care for Huanbi and Jinxi.

374
00:27:55,680-->00:28:01,39
But if they are not submitted to torture, you put yourself in a dilemma.

375
00:28:01,119-->00:28:04,160
You must bear the heartache.

376
00:28:05,960-->00:28:08,760
Imperial Brother, I heard everything.

377
00:28:11,79-->00:28:14,279
Forgive me, Your Majesty. I came to greet the Empress Dowager,

378
00:28:14,359-->00:28:16,480
but found the Imperial Harem in absolute silence,

379
00:28:16,559-->00:28:18,200
excepting the palace of the Empress.

380
00:28:18,279-->00:28:21,559
So I decided to come here only to hear those words at the door.

381
00:28:23,160-->00:28:25,119
As a clan relative, I wish to affirm

382
00:28:25,200-->00:28:27,560
my faith in Noble Consort Xi and her children.

383
00:28:27,640-->00:28:29,599
Ever since she came to the palace,

384
00:28:29,680-->00:28:31,480
she has diligently managed affairs herself.

385
00:28:31,559-->00:28:34,440
I believe in Noble Consort Xi.

386
00:28:34,519-->00:28:38,359
Count Shen has a proud heart and never associates with concubines,

387
00:28:38,440-->00:28:41,400
but strangely he has such fine words for Noble Consort Xi.

388
00:28:41,479-->00:28:45,159
You say she has managed affairs herself as if you had seen it with your own eyes.

389
00:28:45,240-->00:28:48,160
I need not.

390
00:28:48,239-->00:28:52,39
I can tell by her slender frame that she has spared no effort.

391
00:28:52,119-->00:28:56,520
While your plump body, Lady Qi, is the sign of a comfortable life.

392
00:28:56,599-->00:28:58,519
- You– - You shut up!

393
00:29:01,319-->00:29:03,840
Having Count Shen's pledge of faith is a good thing,

394
00:29:03,920-->00:29:08,79
but His Majesty has high hopes for the Sixth Prince.

395
00:29:08,160-->00:29:11,240
For the sake of the generations to come, we must be thorough.

396
00:29:11,319-->00:29:13,119
In that case,

397
00:29:14,119-->00:29:16,559
what do you suggest?

398
00:29:16,640-->00:29:19,679
The only manner to prove his kinship is through a blood test.

399
00:29:28,200-->00:29:31,280
I learned of it from the imperial doctors.

400
00:29:31,359-->00:29:34,40
A drop of blood from each individual

401
00:29:34,119-->00:29:38,79
is dripped into the same container to see if the blood intermingles.

402
00:29:38,839-->00:29:41,240
If it does, they are kin.

403
00:29:41,839-->00:29:44,599
Otherwise, they are not.

404
00:29:46,280-->00:29:47,959
This is fairly easy,

405
00:29:48,39-->00:29:51,200
but I dare not harm Your Majesty

406
00:29:51,280-->00:29:54,319
to obtain a drop of blood.

407
00:29:54,400-->00:29:56,200
Your Majesty,

408
00:29:56,279-->00:30:00,519
even if Hongyan is proved to be your son by the blood test,

409
00:30:00,599-->00:30:04,119
it will harm your paternal bond with him if he learns of it when grown up.

410
00:30:04,200-->00:30:06,559
Despite your great expectations for Hongyan,

411
00:30:06,640-->00:30:08,440
others will speak ill of him due to this test.

412
00:30:08,519-->00:30:11,559
This is exactly why the test must be performed.

413
00:30:12,160-->00:30:14,160
On this matter, there is no room for error,

414
00:30:14,239-->00:30:18,239
or Your Majesty could hand the entire empire to an outsider.

415
00:30:24,359-->00:30:27,599
I thought we were deeply in love, Your Majesty,

416
00:30:28,920-->00:30:32,359
but things take a sudden turn and fall apart.

417
00:30:34,599-->00:30:37,400
If I had known you would come to suspect me,

418
00:30:38,79-->00:30:42,680
I would rather have lived out my days all alone at Mount Lingyun.

419
00:30:49,40-->00:30:50,519
Huan Huan,

420
00:30:52,400-->00:30:54,519
as soon as the test is done,

421
00:30:54,600-->00:30:57,999
you and your children may be proved innocent.

422
00:31:00,359-->00:31:02,519
Your Majesty actually desires to do it,

423
00:31:03,119-->00:31:05,680
for you do suspect me.

424
00:31:11,960-->00:31:16,199
Since you suspect that Doctor Wen and I have had an affair,

425
00:31:18,359-->00:31:20,440
then it is enough

426
00:31:20,519-->00:31:23,519
for Hongyan and Doctor Wen to do the blood test.

427
00:31:24,960-->00:31:28,239
Your Majesty will not be harmed

428
00:31:28,960-->00:31:31,319
and our innocence may be proved.

429
00:31:31,920-->00:31:35,839
- Su Peisheng, bring the Sixth Prince. - Yes, Your Majesty.

430
00:31:38,799-->00:31:42,160
You shall prepare the materials for the blood test.

431
00:31:42,760-->00:31:44,239
Yes, Your Majesty.

432
00:31:55,39-->00:31:59,0
- Your Majesty, the Sixth Prince– - Get a drop of his blood.

433
00:32:08,639-->00:32:09,679
Wen Shichu.

434
00:32:43,919-->00:32:47,79
- It is impossible, Your Majesty! - Zhen Huan, on your knees!

435
00:32:48,319-->00:32:50,359
I have done nothing wrong. Why should I kneel?

436
00:32:50,960-->00:32:52,999
If the blood intermingles, they are kin.

437
00:32:53,959-->00:32:56,119
There is nothing left to say.

438
00:32:56,200-->00:32:59,400
Now, strip off the emblems of her rank and send her to the Cold Palace,

439
00:33:00,40-->00:33:02,719
together with that little bastard!

440
00:33:02,800-->00:33:05,440
Wen Shichu shall be flogged to death at once!

441
00:33:05,519-->00:33:06,680
Who dares!

442
00:33:13,919-->00:33:15,440
I have treated you well.

443
00:33:17,240-->00:33:21,640
Why have you done this to me?

444
00:33:23,679-->00:33:25,599
Your Majesty!

445
00:33:27,960-->00:33:29,480
See it with your own eyes!

446
00:33:33,719-->00:33:37,639
Something must be wrong with the water.

447
00:33:39,399-->00:33:42,159
Your Majesty, something is wrong with the water.

448
00:33:57,119-->00:33:58,400
Your Majesty!

449
00:33:58,479-->00:34:01,880
Something is truly wrong with the water. Any person's blood intermingles in it.

450
00:34:01,959-->00:34:03,759
Your Majesty, please look closely.

451
00:34:10,360-->00:34:11,800
Something is wrong with the water.

452
00:34:11,880-->00:34:15,599
Your Majesty, someone has played a dirty trick with the water.

453
00:34:15,679-->00:34:17,800
Your Majesty, my lady is innocent.

454
00:34:17,880-->00:34:19,879
Your Majesty, it is impossible!

455
00:34:19,960-->00:34:21,880
I am infertile.

456
00:34:21,959-->00:34:25,560
Doctor Wen and Jinxi could never be my children!

457
00:34:25,639-->00:34:26,960
I know.

458
00:34:31,480-->00:34:35,159
Your Majesty, this water tastes sour, for white alum has been added to it.

459
00:34:35,239-->00:34:37,319
Your Majesty, as stated in the ancient medical books,

460
00:34:37,400-->00:34:38,920
if white alum is added to water,

461
00:34:38,999-->00:34:41,639
even the blood of strangers will intermingle.

462
00:34:41,719-->00:34:46,639
If oil is added, even the blood of true kin will not, Your Majesty.

463
00:34:49,0-->00:34:53,920
Your Majesty, whoever is behind this has a wicked heart.

464
00:35:22,519-->00:35:25,880
To keep the test just and fair,

465
00:35:27,560-->00:35:30,599
the Empress herself prepared the water.

466
00:35:32,880-->00:35:36,479
You are quite knowledgeable about medicine, aren't you?

467
00:35:36,559-->00:35:38,800
If I played such a trick,

468
00:35:38,880-->00:35:41,520
I would be easily caught.

469
00:35:41,600-->00:35:42,800
Would it not be too risky?

470
00:35:43,840-->00:35:47,159
Your Majesty, as the proverb says,

471
00:35:47,239-->00:35:50,239
"A tiger cub cannot be caught without entering the tiger's lair."

472
00:35:50,320-->00:35:53,239
It is worth the risk.

473
00:35:53,320-->00:35:57,280
If it worked as intended, the Sixth Prince would be branded as Doctor Wen's son.

474
00:35:57,360-->00:35:58,840
Who would perform the test again?

475
00:36:01,400-->00:36:04,920
Your Majesty, I did not do it. Please see the truth.

476
00:36:05,960-->00:36:10,999
As the Empress, why should I resort to a malicious plan to frame Noble Consort Xi?

477
00:36:11,79-->00:36:16,120
Precisely. As the Empress, what more could you desire?

478
00:36:17,199-->00:36:19,560
Please see the truth, Your Majesty.

479
00:36:23,440-->00:36:27,280
Your Majesty, if I had not seen through the trick in time,

480
00:36:27,920-->00:36:31,840
Hongyan would have been killed in spite of being your son.

481
00:36:33,679-->00:36:38,840
Your Highness, I have respected you and I have shown you deference.

482
00:36:38,920-->00:36:41,719
I do not know how you have been so sorely offended

483
00:36:41,800-->00:36:44,480
as to inflict this calamity on me.

484
00:36:50,519-->00:36:53,800
Your Majesty, I have brought some clean water.

485
00:36:53,880-->00:36:56,280
I am certain that nothing has been added to it.

486
00:36:58,40-->00:37:00,159
- Test it again. - Yes, Your Majesty.

487
00:37:27,519-->00:37:28,519
Your Majesty,

488
00:37:30,119-->00:37:31,719
please look.

489
00:37:50,719-->00:37:54,880
Your Majesty, this test shall resolve your suspicion.

490
00:38:07,719-->00:38:10,399
Huan Huan, I–

491
00:38:11,679-->00:38:15,280
I have done you wrong. I shall indulge suspicion no more.

492
00:38:17,599-->00:38:19,519
At last,

493
00:38:20,919-->00:38:22,800
I have been proven innocent.

494
00:38:24,399-->00:38:25,639
Sit.

495
00:38:26,960-->00:38:31,800
Lady Qi, it has come to an end. What more do you have to say?

496
00:38:33,920-->00:38:36,40
Your Majesty, the Sixth Prince may indeed be your son,

497
00:38:36,119-->00:38:38,999
but it has been proven that she had a love affair with Doctor Wen.

498
00:38:39,80-->00:38:41,400
You must not turn a blind eye to it!

499
00:38:41,479-->00:38:44,360
I dare not deceive you, Your Majesty!

500
00:38:44,440-->00:38:46,39
You might not believe me,

501
00:38:47,159-->00:38:49,360
but Jingbai can be trusted.

502
00:38:51,79-->00:38:54,280
Buddha be trusted, a nun may never lie.

503
00:38:54,359-->00:38:58,719
Jingbai, you have brought shame upon your entire order.

504
00:39:03,599-->00:39:07,400
Sister Huan, I was very worried at your long absence.

505
00:39:07,880-->00:39:10,599
- Are you all right? - Yes.

506
00:39:12,879-->00:39:14,680
Your Majesty, on my way back,

507
00:39:14,760-->00:39:19,839
I encountered Miss Yurao with the maids and eunuchs, looking for Noble Consort Xi.

508
00:39:19,920-->00:39:22,159
With her was eunuch Xiao Yunzi.

509
00:39:22,239-->00:39:25,360
He stated that he knew someone from Ganlu Temple.

510
00:39:25,960-->00:39:30,800
I felt the one-sided account of Jingbai might not be reliable. More is needed.

511
00:39:31,320-->00:39:35,640
So I gave Xiao Yunzi my entry pass and sent him for his acquaintance.

512
00:39:35,800-->00:39:39,159
Miss Yurao and Xiao Yunzi were unexpectedly swift.

513
00:39:39,960-->00:39:42,879
Jingbai is not the only nun at Ganlu Temple.

514
00:39:43,479-->00:39:46,199
Your Majesty, you shall hear another witness.

515
00:39:53,599-->00:39:54,920
It has been years, my lady.

516
00:39:54,999-->00:39:57,879
Do the chilblains on your hands still torment you in the winter?

517
00:39:59,480-->00:40:01,320
Not so much,

518
00:40:02,79-->00:40:05,360
but they still cause pain and they itch in the winter.

519
00:40:06,840-->00:40:08,80
Now then.

520
00:40:08,760-->00:40:11,920
How do you know about the chilblains on her hands?

521
00:40:13,519-->00:40:18,119
She used to chop wood, wash clothing and do all the heavy work at Ganlu Temple.

522
00:40:18,199-->00:40:21,320
Her hands were soaked in the river in severe winters.

523
00:40:21,400-->00:40:23,280
It was impossible not to develop chilblains.

524
00:40:23,359-->00:40:26,560
If she did not perform these tasks, Jingbai would scold and beat her.

525
00:40:26,639-->00:40:28,119
Noble Consort Xi often fell ill

526
00:40:28,199-->00:40:32,679
and was driven away to Mount Lingyun by Jingbai in a heavy blizzard,

527
00:40:32,760-->00:40:34,439
which nearly cost her life.

528
00:40:35,39-->00:40:37,680
Mount Lingyun is a remote and inaccessible place,

529
00:40:37,760-->00:40:39,440
where feral cats attack.

530
00:40:39,520-->00:40:41,760
If Noble Consort Xi did have an affair with Doctor Wen,

531
00:40:41,839-->00:40:43,760
she could have left behind that desolate place

532
00:40:43,840-->00:40:46,679
and spared herself from such suffering.

533
00:40:51,800-->00:40:56,280
Huan Huan, you have truly been wronged.

534
00:40:56,360-->00:40:58,159
Noble Consort Xi has suffered deep humiliation.

535
00:40:58,239-->00:41:00,880
Your Majesty, this nun must be severely punished.

536
00:41:02,439-->00:41:05,640
What do you suggest?

537
00:41:05,719-->00:41:08,440
This nun has an evil mind

538
00:41:08,520-->00:41:10,560
paired with a wicked tongue.

539
00:41:10,639-->00:41:14,760
Her tongue must be pulled out in revenge for what she has done.

540
00:41:16,159-->00:41:18,679
I always thought you gentle and kind, Concubine An.

541
00:41:18,760-->00:41:22,959
I am surprised you can be so merciless.

542
00:41:25,520-->00:41:28,840
Save me, Lady Qi!

543
00:41:28,919-->00:41:31,320
Please save me!

544
00:41:31,400-->00:41:34,519
Have mercy, Your Majesty! I beg you, Your Highness!

545
00:41:34,600-->00:41:39,199
Young mistress, forgive me.

546
00:41:39,800-->00:41:42,920
I had no choice but to come here,

547
00:41:43,760-->00:41:46,520
or Lady Qi–

548
00:41:47,39-->00:41:51,199
Lady Qi would have Chen Si beat me to death.

549
00:41:52,919-->00:41:54,840
Your Majesty,

550
00:41:54,920-->00:41:58,239
the young mistress has known Doctor Wen for a long time,

551
00:41:58,320-->00:42:02,639
and it has always been purely friendship, no more.

552
00:42:02,719-->00:42:05,800
Please see the truth, Your Majesty.

553
00:42:09,39-->00:42:13,919
Your Majesty, that Lady Qi induced Bin-er, Feiwen and Jingbai to slander me

554
00:42:15,280-->00:42:17,719
is now self-evident.

555
00:42:17,800-->00:42:21,559
But someone might be behind Lady Qi,

556
00:42:22,639-->00:42:24,840
or she would not dare be so bold

557
00:42:25,960-->00:42:27,560
nor plan so thoroughly.

558
00:42:29,159-->00:42:31,559
Noble Consort Xi is right.

559
00:42:31,639-->00:42:34,760
If this person is left in the palace to stir up trouble,

560
00:42:34,839-->00:42:38,959
we shall have no peace in the future.

561
00:42:40,880-->00:42:43,719
No one incited me. It was my own idea!

562
00:42:44,680-->00:42:47,399
How pleasant to have your own sister in the palace.

563
00:42:48,280-->00:42:53,40
When I see Noble Consort Xi with her sister,

564
00:42:55,199-->00:42:57,639
it brings back memories, Your Majesty,

565
00:42:57,719-->00:43:02,880
of serving alongside my elder sister in the Duke's residence.

566
00:43:04,400-->00:43:06,40
Your Majesty,

567
00:43:06,959-->00:43:09,520
were my sister alive today,

568
00:43:09,599-->00:43:13,840
she would believe my innocence.

569
00:43:15,480-->00:43:19,879
Would that she never had a sister such as you.

570
00:43:27,840-->00:43:29,40
You may rise.

571
00:43:34,200-->00:43:37,559
Lady Qi of the Guwalgiya clan,

572
00:43:38,239-->00:43:40,679
for stirring up trouble in the Harem with inflammatory rumors,

573
00:43:41,719-->00:43:43,599
shall be sent to the Cold Palace.

574
00:43:44,360-->00:43:47,280
First Attendant Kang and Concubine Zheng,

575
00:43:48,119-->00:43:51,800
acted upon hearsay and rumors and shall forfeit six-months' stipend.

576
00:43:52,480-->00:43:55,799
The fate of the others shall be decided by Noble Consort Xi.

577
00:44:02,840-->00:44:04,839
- Jinxi. - Yes, my lady.

578
00:44:04,920-->00:44:08,999
- Accompany Bin-er and Moyan out. - Yes, my lady.

579
00:44:10,999-->00:44:13,919
Feiwen and Jingbai

580
00:44:15,80-->00:44:16,880
shall be flogged to death.

581
00:44:17,920-->00:44:20,360
Have mercy, Noble Consort Xi! Your Majesty, I beg you!

582
00:44:20,440-->00:44:21,919
Have mercy, Noble Consort Xi!

583
00:44:24,39-->00:44:26,239
My lady, here is the tongue of Jingbai.

584
00:44:26,560-->00:44:29,280
- Present it to Madam Guwalgiya. - Yes, my lady.

585
00:44:29,360-->00:44:33,560
With this extra tongue, she shall learn to watch her own.

586
00:44:34,280-->00:44:35,760
You are vicious to the core.

587
00:44:36,679-->00:44:38,999
I thank Concubine An for her suggestion.

588
00:44:42,800-->00:44:43,800
Wen Shichu!

589
00:44:47,120-->00:44:51,519
Though you have had no affair with her, can you swear on your family

590
00:44:51,599-->00:44:54,999
that you have no improper feelings towards any of the concubines?

591
00:44:55,840-->00:44:59,559
Young mistress, you are quite out of your mind.

592
00:45:00,400-->00:45:01,800
Your Majesty!

593
00:45:01,880-->00:45:03,800
I have served you for years.

594
00:45:03,880-->00:45:07,840
Why do you only have eyes for that offending wretch?

595
00:45:07,919-->00:45:11,679
- Remove her. - Your Majesty!

596
00:45:13,159-->00:45:14,440
Your Majesty!

597
00:45:14,519-->00:45:19,119
Wen Shichu, as long as you are with her, you will do her harm one day!

598
00:45:19,200-->00:45:23,359
I will wait for that day to come! Your Majesty!

599
00:45:23,440-->00:45:26,360
Doctor Wen, you are well aware

600
00:45:26,960-->00:45:30,280
that by your affection alone

601
00:45:30,959-->00:45:33,520
you will bring harm upon others.

602
00:45:45,599-->00:45:47,920
Your Majesty, my lady.

603
00:45:49,960-->00:45:52,199
I shall prove my loyalty.

604
00:45:55,560-->00:45:59,199
My lady, Jingren Palace is in chaos. Noble Consort Xi was wronged.

605
00:45:59,280-->00:46:02,560
- Concubine An sent me to report to you. - What happened?

606
00:46:02,639-->00:46:05,679
Lady Qi claimed that the Sixth Prince was Doctor Wen's son.

607
00:46:07,280-->00:46:09,719
Young mistress!

608
00:46:09,840-->00:46:12,600
We leave for Jingren Palace at once!

609
00:46:15,599-->00:46:17,280
Tormented for the whole day,

610
00:46:18,679-->00:46:20,199
I am weary.

611
00:46:21,199-->00:46:23,400
You must be weary as well, Empress.

612
00:46:24,399-->00:46:26,400
You have been in ill health.

613
00:46:27,280-->00:46:32,639
The affairs of the Imperial Harem shall be left in the hands of Noble Consort Xi.

614
00:46:32,719-->00:46:33,920
Your Majesty!

615
00:46:34,0-->00:46:36,760
Consort Duan and Consort Jing shall help her.

616
00:46:39,760-->00:46:44,119
You shall dedicate yourself entirely to your health.

617
00:46:44,800-->00:46:46,400
You must not overexert yourself.

618
00:46:59,119-->00:47:00,959
Your Majesty,

619
00:47:01,39-->00:47:03,960
Doctor Wen has castrated himself and is on the verge of death!

620
00:47:07,280-->00:47:08,800
Young mistress!

621
00:47:09,679-->00:47:11,639
Send for an imperial doctor!

622
00:47:14,0-->00:47:15,280
Quickly! Hold on!

623
00:47:15,360-->00:47:16,679
Take this medicine. Quickly!

624
00:47:16,760-->00:47:18,599
Push, young mistress!

625
00:47:19,280-->00:47:20,519
Almost there! Almost there!

626
00:47:20,600-->00:47:22,480
Young mistress, push harder!

627
00:47:23,40-->00:47:24,39
Push harder! Young mistress!

628
00:47:24,359-->00:47:26,479
How is he? Hold on!

629
00:47:26,560-->00:47:30,280
Fetch some coagulating agent! It may save his life!

630
00:47:30,360-->00:47:32,120
Young mistress, push!

631
00:47:32,199-->00:47:35,119
Hold on, young mistress!

632
00:47:35,199-->00:47:36,800
Fetch more hot water!

633
00:47:36,880-->00:47:38,359
Quickly!

634
00:47:38,440-->00:47:40,920
Why does she bleed so profusely?

635
00:47:40,999-->00:47:45,280
You were aware that Mei was to be spared any shocks during pregnancy.

636
00:47:46,760-->00:47:49,639
Yet your maid still sent word to Suiyu Pavilion.

637
00:47:50,879-->00:47:52,239
Lingrong.

638
00:47:54,80-->00:47:56,199
What fell intentions do you harbor in your mind?

639
00:47:58,800-->00:48:02,199
I had no knowledge of it. I'm sure Baoque didn't do it on purpose.

640
00:48:02,280-->00:48:06,320
If I knew it would come to this, I would rather suffer in Mei's stead.

641
00:48:06,400-->00:48:08,719
We were selected together. I–

642
00:48:14,159-->00:48:16,599
Whether intentional or not is now of no import.

643
00:48:16,679-->00:48:19,280
It can be forgotten if Mei and her child are saved.

644
00:48:19,360-->00:48:21,760
Otherwise,

645
00:48:21,840-->00:48:24,440
you will answer for it.

646
00:48:27,39-->00:48:30,280
You are right to hit me. It was my fault for not disciplining my servants,

647
00:48:31,239-->00:48:33,760
causing such a calamity.

648
00:48:33,840-->00:48:36,79
Baoque, come in!

649
00:48:39,880-->00:48:41,39
I bow before you, my lady.

650
00:48:43,879-->00:48:46,480
- You are shameless! - My lady, please forgive me.

651
00:48:47,79-->00:48:48,840
How dare you endanger Concubine Hui's safety!

652
00:48:48,920-->00:48:51,519
You were trying to embarrass me, weren't you?

653
00:48:51,599-->00:48:53,199
My lady, have mercy!

654
00:48:53,280-->00:48:55,719
I have been close friends with Mei for years.

655
00:48:55,799-->00:48:58,239
Yet, wretch that you are, you startled Mei and provoked her labor.

656
00:48:59,320-->00:49:02,920
You talked too much, vile scum!

657
00:49:02,999-->00:49:06,280
The maid has no sense. Don't break the rules, Concubine An.

658
00:49:07,680-->00:49:09,880
May blessings and peace be with you, Your Majesty.

659
00:49:11,839-->00:49:13,79
If servants break the rules,

660
00:49:14,79-->00:49:16,679
just drag them to a quiet place and flog them to death.

661
00:49:16,760-->00:49:18,639
- Su Peisheng. - Yes, Your Majesty.

662
00:49:18,719-->00:49:20,960
- Guards! - Your Majesty, have mercy!

663
00:49:21,40-->00:49:24,320
I am at fault. I will never do it again!

664
00:49:24,399-->00:49:26,479
- Spare me, Your Majesty! - Remove her.

665
00:49:26,560-->00:49:29,959
I will never do it again! Have mercy, Your Majesty!

666
00:49:30,40-->00:49:32,159
Never again!

667
00:49:35,400-->00:49:37,80
Your Majesty.

668
00:49:37,159-->00:49:40,79
Doctor Wen has stopped bleeding. He will live.

669
00:49:40,960-->00:49:42,0
However–

670
00:49:42,79-->00:49:43,360
Say it.

671
00:49:43,440-->00:49:45,719
Just as all eunuchs,

672
00:49:46,359-->00:49:49,360
he will never father children.

673
00:49:50,119-->00:49:51,719
I know.

674
00:49:52,400-->00:49:54,199
Why hasn't Concubine Hui finished?

675
00:49:54,280-->00:49:56,280
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

676
00:49:58,79-->00:49:59,79
Your Majesty.

677
00:49:59,159-->00:50:03,360
Concubine Hui was shocked enough to affect her pregnancy. She's in danger.

678
00:50:03,439-->00:50:05,199
I have meager knowledge.

679
00:50:05,280-->00:50:07,919
Besides, Doctor Wen is the one who has been looking after her.

680
00:50:08,679-->00:50:11,360
I am ill-informed of her situation.

681
00:50:11,439-->00:50:13,360
If Doctor Wen is present,

682
00:50:13,440-->00:50:15,239
though he cannot deliver the baby,

683
00:50:15,319-->00:50:17,920
with his detailed knowledge of her state of health,

684
00:50:17,999-->00:50:20,159
he can discuss the treatment strategy with me.

685
00:50:21,679-->00:50:23,159
Hasten to bring Wen Shichu here.

686
00:50:27,239-->00:50:29,400
Master!

687
00:50:30,40-->00:50:31,639
Wei Lin!

688
00:50:32,520-->00:50:36,199
Wei Lin, Concubine Hui's body is of warm constitution.

689
00:50:36,280-->00:50:41,159
She's having a difficult labor due to an imbalance of the chi and the blood.

690
00:50:41,239-->00:50:45,239
Hasten to give her wild ginseng to raise her energy,

691
00:50:45,319-->00:50:48,320
followed by the medicinal tonic for bleeding after childbirth, hurry!

692
00:50:48,399-->00:50:50,280
Yes, master. Hurry to prepare them!

693
00:50:50,400-->00:50:53,639
Your Majesty, the medicine has been administered as Doctor Wen instructed.

694
00:50:53,719-->00:50:57,639
She is bleeding less and can push now.

695
00:50:57,719-->00:51:00,999
Send my decree to Concubine Hui.

696
00:51:01,80-->00:51:05,320
She is now promoted to Consort Hui and may give birth at ease.

697
00:51:05,400-->00:51:08,119
- Yes, Your Majesty. - I am greatly indebted to Mei.

698
00:51:08,800-->00:51:11,239
After she has given birth to the imperial child safely,

699
00:51:11,320-->00:51:13,320
I must make recompense.

700
00:51:21,280-->00:51:24,120
Congratulations, Your Majesty! It is a princess!

701
00:51:25,480-->00:51:26,920
Wonderful!

702
00:51:27,0-->00:51:28,479
How is Consort Hui?

703
00:51:28,559-->00:51:31,599
The young mistress is worn out. She cannot even speak.

704
00:51:31,679-->00:51:34,679
- I shall visit her. - She is exhausted from childbirth.

705
00:51:34,760-->00:51:37,239
It's better she rested, Your Majesty.

706
00:51:38,760-->00:51:41,199
You must be tired, Your Majesty. Please return and rest.

707
00:51:41,280-->00:51:43,559
When Mei recovers strength, you may visit her.

708
00:51:43,640-->00:51:46,480
I will stay here with Mei. No need to worry, Your Majesty.

709
00:51:46,559-->00:51:47,560
Very well.

710
00:51:48,320-->00:51:52,40
But you must rest as well. Don't wear yourself out.

711
00:51:53,559-->00:51:55,760
I shall return with you, Your Majesty.

712
00:51:56,360-->00:51:58,360
I bid farewell to Your Majesty.

713
00:52:01,880-->00:52:03,79
How joyous!

714
00:52:03,160-->00:52:05,640
You need not worry anymore, my lady.

715
00:52:06,599-->00:52:08,199
Have some tea.

716
00:52:08,920-->00:52:11,239
Things have turned bad!

717
00:52:11,320-->00:52:13,599
The young mistress is bleeding profusely again!

718
00:52:14,840-->00:52:17,920
How is she? Hurry to fetch some coagulating agent!

719
00:52:17,999-->00:52:20,39
It's no use.

720
00:52:21,119-->00:52:22,760
Who said that?

721
00:52:23,959-->00:52:25,560
Fetch the best medicine!

722
00:52:25,639-->00:52:27,719
If she is not saved, I will bury you all with her!

723
00:52:27,840-->00:52:29,40
Yes, my lady.

724
00:52:32,439-->00:52:33,840
Huan.

725
00:52:34,760-->00:52:37,40
- Mei. - Don't cry.

726
00:52:37,639-->00:52:40,560
I need to speak with you.

727
00:52:41,880-->00:52:45,719
Please send everyone out.

728
00:52:46,639-->00:52:51,760
- Leave us. - Wen Shichu, you stay.

729
00:52:58,0-->00:53:00,119
Shichu,

730
00:53:01,80-->00:53:03,599
have you held her yet?

731
00:53:04,200-->00:53:06,440
Hold her.

732
00:53:09,920-->00:53:11,600
I–

733
00:53:12,639-->00:53:13,960
I dare not.

734
00:53:14,519-->00:53:16,440
I know.

735
00:53:17,920-->00:53:20,919
I know you have always resented me.

736
00:53:22,0-->00:53:23,359
That night,

737
00:53:23,440-->00:53:28,800
I tricked you into drinking the wine sent by the Empress Dowager for His Majesty.

738
00:53:30,480-->00:53:33,679
For you, it will be a lifelong regret.

739
00:53:36,479-->00:53:40,320
Mei, you have been very imprudent.

740
00:53:44,280-->00:53:48,639
I am glad to have been imprudent for once.

741
00:53:49,839-->00:53:53,119
I have no regrets.

742
00:53:56,239-->00:53:57,360
Shichu.

743
00:53:59,280-->00:54:03,639
I wish to ask you a question.

744
00:54:04,719-->00:54:06,760
In all these years,

745
00:54:08,119-->00:54:09,840
have you ever

746
00:54:10,599-->00:54:14,280
truly loved me a little?

747
00:54:14,919-->00:54:16,599
Even for a moment?

748
00:54:23,400-->00:54:27,400
The wine alone was not enough for me to be enamored.

749
00:54:28,800-->00:54:30,239
Therefore...

750
00:54:33,399-->00:54:35,400
it is not merely for the sake of Huan

751
00:54:36,440-->00:54:40,280
that I have treated you with special care.

752
00:54:42,960-->00:54:44,719
Truly?

753
00:54:47,320-->00:54:52,999
I do not regret meeting you in this life.

754
00:54:55,199-->00:54:56,679
Shichu,

755
00:54:58,400-->00:54:59,840
hold her.

756
00:55:01,400-->00:55:05,559
- Hold our child. - Yes.

757
00:55:12,879-->00:55:14,440
Shichu,

758
00:55:15,800-->00:55:20,320
you must watch her grow up

759
00:55:21,440-->00:55:24,559
and protect her from all harm.

760
00:55:26,639-->00:55:27,920
Huan,

761
00:55:28,879-->00:55:33,560
please assist Shichu with our child.

762
00:55:57,960-->00:55:59,480
How wonderful.

763
00:56:00,800-->00:56:03,760
I have never once

764
00:56:04,519-->00:56:09,440
lain down

765
00:56:10,679-->00:56:12,760
like this

766
00:56:13,440-->00:56:17,439
in your arms–

767
00:56:30,319-->00:56:35,479
Light and shade

768
00:56:35,559-->00:56:41,239
upon her bed-screen's peaks

769
00:56:41,920-->00:56:47,280
Her hair drifts cloud-like

770
00:56:47,360-->00:56:52,519
across rosy cheeks

771
00:56:52,639-->00:56:55,880
Idly she rises to paint her brows

772
00:56:55,960-->00:56:57,840
SUIYU PAVILION

773
00:56:58,960-->00:57:04,39
Dallying with her makeup and hair

774
00:57:04,639-->00:57:09,760
Admiring herself front and back in the mirror

775
00:57:10,239-->00:57:13,239
Her face rivals blossoms in beauty

776
00:57:13,320-->00:57:15,239
IN MEMORY OF SHEN MEIZHUANG

777
00:57:16,120-->00:57:21,719
Embroidered on the silken vest she wears

778
00:57:21,800-->00:57:26,679
Golden partridges fly in pairs

779
00:57:27,439-->00:57:33,360
Embroidered on the silken vest she wears

780
00:57:33,439-->00:57:38,199
Golden partridges fly in pairs

781
00:57:39,39-->00:57:45,599
Golden partridges fly in pairs

782
00:57:46,840-->00:57:49,719
Have you arranged for Baoque's funeral?

783
00:57:50,280-->00:57:52,119
Yes, my lady.

784
00:57:52,199-->00:57:55,960
But, young mistress, you continue to think of Baoque in times such as this.

785
00:57:57,79-->00:57:58,879
Then what should I be thinking of?

786
00:57:58,960-->00:58:02,520
Young mistress, His Majesty hasn't visited for quite some time,

787
00:58:02,599-->00:58:04,800
and you are not seeking a solution.

788
00:58:06,479-->00:58:08,359
He is grieving the loss of Consort Hui.

789
00:58:09,359-->00:58:13,879
In truth, even if Consort Hui had lived, she would not stand in our way.

790
00:58:13,960-->00:58:16,520
But she was dear to Zhen Huan.

791
00:58:17,760-->00:58:19,800
She had to die

792
00:58:19,879-->00:58:21,919
so that Zhen Huan would be devastated.

793
00:58:23,599-->00:58:26,880
And when I see Zhen Huan heartbroken,

794
00:58:28,919-->00:58:33,479
my rage is satiated.

795
00:58:36,159-->00:58:37,999
Consort Hui,

796
00:58:39,719-->00:58:41,839
your death could be considered unjust.

797
00:58:41,920-->00:58:46,80
This is for you.

798
00:58:51,519-->00:58:53,280
Hold her.

799
00:58:53,359-->00:58:55,280
She is gaining weight.

800
00:58:58,879-->00:59:00,559
The day Mei was placed in the coffin,

801
00:59:02,120-->00:59:05,440
I placed the jade vessel I inherited beside her.

802
00:59:06,599-->00:59:08,440
Perhaps I should have given it to her earlier.

803
00:59:09,639-->00:59:14,400
I was a fool to have made her live with regret all these years.

804
00:59:15,679-->00:59:17,439
All my life,

805
00:59:18,479-->00:59:20,239
I have failed her.

806
00:59:20,760-->00:59:22,959
You must plan for your child.

807
00:59:23,40-->00:59:24,920
Will you lose yourself in drink forever?

808
00:59:24,999-->00:59:28,280
Huan, His Majesty has granted me permission

809
00:59:30,559-->00:59:34,760
to guard her grave for three years to atone for my grave error.

810
00:59:36,440-->00:59:39,520
I understand, Shichu. But the deceased never return.

811
00:59:40,120-->00:59:45,760
You must live well so that Mei can be at peace in the underworld.

812
00:59:50,519-->00:59:52,800
Noble Consort Xi, I gather you are not yet aware

813
00:59:52,880-->00:59:54,880
that Concubine An's father has been accused

814
00:59:54,960-->00:59:58,400
of ransacking several mansions and stealing 800,000 taels of silver.

815
00:59:58,479-->01:0:1,959
His Majesty is enraged.

816
01:0:3,760-->01:0:6,800
I wouldn't have known if you hadn't told me.

817
01:0:6,880-->01:0:10,120
He is now the laughingstock of the palace.

818
01:0:11,119-->01:0:14,320
You are clever to have your father spy on An Bihuai

819
01:0:14,400-->01:0:16,359
so that his crime will be known.

820
01:0:16,440-->01:0:18,639
Otherwise, Concubine An will grow overproud.

821
01:0:18,719-->01:0:20,479
Were it not for your plan, my lady,

822
01:0:20,559-->01:0:24,159
the evidence I found of An Bihuai's crime would be of little use.

823
01:0:24,239-->01:0:26,600
His Majesty is still angry with the Guwalgiya clan.

824
01:0:26,679-->01:0:28,679
It is An Bihuai who has brought about his own downfall.

825
01:0:28,760-->01:0:31,840
I beg you to rescue my father, Your Highness.

826
01:0:31,920-->01:0:33,280
Your Highness!

827
01:0:33,360-->01:0:36,239
I would help you if I could,

828
01:0:36,320-->01:0:40,439
but I am afraid you are on your own.

829
01:0:40,520-->01:0:42,760
Please show me the right path, Your Highness.

830
01:0:42,840-->01:0:46,80
His Majesty is kindhearted and greatly values his offspring.

831
01:0:46,159-->01:0:49,119
You have never conceived in all of these years.

832
01:0:51,360-->01:0:55,480
I have a secret prescription which is miraculously effective,

833
01:0:55,560-->01:0:57,39
but quite fierce in nature.

834
01:0:57,639-->01:1:1,679
If you bear offspring for His Majesty, you shall regain his favor.

835
01:1:1,760-->01:1:3,599
He will then take care of your family.

836
01:1:4,280-->01:1:7,680
But I used a weight-reducing treatment.

837
01:1:8,520-->01:1:11,600
Even if I conceive a child for His Majesty,

838
01:1:11,679-->01:1:14,40
I cannot carry it to full term, Your Highness.

839
01:1:14,119-->01:1:16,800
If conception itself is enough to meet your pressing need,

840
01:1:16,880-->01:1:19,519
why do you need to give birth?

841
01:1:33,960-->01:1:35,559
Excellent!

842
01:1:55,160-->01:1:59,159
Yunxi has improved much, excelling at horse-riding and archery.

843
01:1:59,239-->01:2:4,320
These skills were also taught to Yunli by our Imperial Father.

844
01:2:4,400-->01:2:6,519
Now he has forgotten them all.

845
01:2:6,599-->01:2:9,679
Your Majesty, I have indulged in drink.

846
01:2:10,760-->01:2:11,839
I am not in proper form.

847
01:2:14,40-->01:2:15,959
Brother Yunli has not yet married.

848
01:2:16,39-->01:2:19,239
When he does, his strength will be drained.

849
01:2:22,159-->01:2:24,760
Had I known this was planned, I would not have drunk as much.

850
01:2:25,399-->01:2:27,760
I've gotten drunk before firing a single arrow.

851
01:2:29,680-->01:2:30,999
Fill his cup.

852
01:2:34,719-->01:2:37,840
- Forgive me, my lord! - Merely a piece of clothing.

853
01:2:38,559-->01:2:40,599
I will change in the side hall.

854
01:2:42,79-->01:2:43,440
What is that?

855
01:2:45,80-->01:2:46,880
Give it to me.

856
01:2:52,519-->01:2:56,479
Yunli must be in love,

857
01:2:57,400-->01:3:1,520
or he would not have such a feminine article on his person.

858
01:3:9,800-->01:3:10,999
That paper cutout

859
01:3:12,239-->01:3:15,119
resembles Noble Consort Xi.

860
01:3:22,119-->01:3:23,880
Indeed it does.

861
01:3:23,959-->01:3:26,360
It does look like Noble Consort Xi,

862
01:3:26,439-->01:3:29,680
but does it not also resemble Huanbi, Your Majesty?

863
01:3:35,400-->01:3:38,159
Next month is the Qixi Festival,

864
01:3:38,239-->01:3:40,639
the perfect occasion to bring their romance to a happy conclusion.

865
01:4:2,40-->01:4:7,199
The color is faded around the edges.

866
01:4:7,680-->01:4:12,80
Yunli must have held it in his hands countless times.

867
01:4:18,999-->01:4:20,519
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

868
01:4:21,159-->01:4:24,679
It is my portrait.

869
01:4:25,679-->01:4:26,719
Truly?

870
01:4:28,919-->01:4:30,119
Seven years ago,

871
01:4:31,39-->01:4:33,119
I myself put the portrait in this sachet.

872
01:4:34,600-->01:4:37,840
At the time, Consort Hua had forced my lady to kneel before Yikun Palace.

873
01:4:37,920-->01:4:41,519
I encountered His Lordship and begged him to help.

874
01:4:41,599-->01:4:45,600
After it was over, I expressed my gratitude in Ninghui Hall,

875
01:4:46,239-->01:4:48,719
where I saw some colored paper on the table.

876
01:4:48,799-->01:4:52,800
His Lordship asked if I knew how to cut portraits,

877
01:4:52,879-->01:4:56,239
so I cut out a portrait of myself and put it in the sachet.

878
01:4:57,199-->01:5:2,639
Once, His Lordship and I met and he asked to know my favorite flower.

879
01:5:2,719-->01:5:5,159
I answered that it was the rabbit-ear iris.

880
01:5:6,760-->01:5:11,640
Your Majesty, you will find petals of rabbit-ear iris in the sachet.

881
01:5:17,999-->01:5:19,719
Indeed.

882
01:5:19,799-->01:5:24,360
If it were not your portrait, how could you know what was in the sachet?

883
01:5:25,79-->01:5:28,839
Huan Huan, have you ever noticed her feelings?

884
01:5:30,320-->01:5:31,600
I have been fooled.

885
01:5:31,999-->01:5:34,359
She has hidden her thoughts from me.

886
01:5:36,199-->01:5:40,519
No wonder Yunli does not have even a secondary spouse.

887
01:5:40,599-->01:5:43,839
Very well, it is decided.

888
01:5:44,440-->01:5:47,760
- I shall betroth Huanbi to you. - Your Majesty!

889
01:5:47,840-->01:5:52,639
As a lowly maid, Your Majesty, I do not deserve this honor.

890
01:5:57,560-->01:6:0,360
When I left the palace to become a nun,

891
01:6:0,440-->01:6:3,79
Jinxi and Huanbi were the only ones to share my weal and woe.

892
01:6:3,999-->01:6:6,560
Huanbi and I grew up together as if we were sisters.

893
01:6:7,519-->01:6:11,239
His Lordship has been in love with Huanbi for seven years.

894
01:6:11,319-->01:6:14,199
I suppose that he does not intend to treat her badly.

895
01:6:15,39-->01:6:16,559
What do you suggest then?

896
01:6:19,40-->01:6:22,560
I shall accept Huanbi as my stepsister and place her name in my lineage.

897
01:6:22,639-->01:6:25,120
She may then be married to Marquess Guo respectably

898
01:6:25,200-->01:6:27,520
as second daughter of the Niohuru clan.

899
01:6:27,599-->01:6:29,279
As you wish.

900
01:6:30,520-->01:6:34,280
Huanbi shall be the secondary spouse of Marquess Guo

901
01:6:34,359-->01:6:36,999
as second daughter of the Niohuru clan.

902
01:6:37,760-->01:6:39,39
Thank you, Your Majesty.

903
01:6:39,120-->01:6:40,599
Congratulations, Marquess Guo!

904
01:6:40,679-->01:6:43,0
-Rise. -Congratulations, Huanbi!

905
01:6:44,639-->01:6:48,880
The Empress Dowager is gravely ill. Your wedding may ward off some bad luck.

906
01:6:50,280-->01:6:53,439
Although the families of this marriage are not well-matched,

907
01:6:53,519-->01:6:56,360
your love is true.

908
01:6:56,440-->01:6:58,159
I shall obey you, Your Majesty.

909
01:6:58,239-->01:7:0,800
Speaking of family status,

910
01:7:1,199-->01:7:3,40
one matter came to my mind.

911
01:7:3,880-->01:7:8,439
Several years ago, the Empress Dowager once proposed a marriage for you.

912
01:7:8,920-->01:7:12,880
She was very fond of Meng Jingxian, daughter of Viscount Pei.

913
01:7:12,959-->01:7:16,559
Now the news of your marriage has spread.

914
01:7:16,639-->01:7:18,799
Viscount Pei cares so much for his daughter

915
01:7:19,400-->01:7:22,120
that he sent me three memoranda consecutively,

916
01:7:22,639-->01:7:26,159
saying that his daughter could become a concubine

917
01:7:26,239-->01:7:28,440
to serve Marquess Guo.

918
01:7:29,119-->01:7:31,119
I have no desire for additional spouses.

919
01:7:31,199-->01:7:34,799
Moreover, Miss Meng has no interest in me. I shall not keep her for nothing.

920
01:7:34,879-->01:7:38,439
Viscount Pei is an elder statesman who has served two emperors.

921
01:7:38,519-->01:7:43,280
He will be pacified by your marriage to his daughter.

922
01:7:43,880-->01:7:48,799
If he becomes resentful over this matter,

923
01:7:48,880-->01:7:52,239
it will do little good for imperial politics.

924
01:7:52,319-->01:7:55,440
Then I shall treat her well.

925
01:8:11,679-->01:8:13,479
I bid you farewell, Noble Consort Xi.

926
01:8:15,919-->01:8:17,399
Take good care.

927
01:8:26,720-->01:8:28,640
The auspicious moment is at hand. All is prepared.

928
01:8:28,720-->01:8:30,0
The daughter of Viscount Pei is on her way.

929
01:8:30,80-->01:8:31,319
Miss Huanbi, you may set off now.

930
01:8:32,880-->01:8:34,479
Go.

931
01:8:39,39-->01:8:40,720
Would that it were you.

932
01:8:43,479-->01:8:45,680
At least he would be truly delighted.

933
01:8:50,680-->01:8:52,800
Huanbi is more fortunate than I.

934
01:8:59,80-->01:9:0,760
He marries two women at once

935
01:9:2,199-->01:9:3,799
but he loves neither.

936
01:9:5,799-->01:9:8,479
Depart!

937
01:9:16,520-->01:9:18,40
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

938
01:9:18,119-->01:9:21,320
Concubine An of Yanxi Palace is three months pregnant.

939
01:9:22,120-->01:9:23,319
Is that true?

940
01:9:23,400-->01:9:26,359
The imperial doctor has felt her pulse. It is entirely true, Your Majesty.

941
01:9:26,959-->01:9:28,479
The Empress kept it a secret

942
01:9:28,919-->01:9:31,760
until the pregnancy of Concubine An became stable.

943
01:9:31,999-->01:9:33,600
You were very thoughtful.

944
01:9:34,199-->01:9:36,359
Concubine An is quite weak.

945
01:9:36,439-->01:9:38,640
She used to have irregular menstruation.

946
01:9:38,720-->01:9:42,359
She did not know until three months had passed.

947
01:9:42,439-->01:9:45,720
Her father is still in prison, so she dares not make it public.

948
01:9:45,800-->01:9:51,599
And I do take precautions against false reports of pregnancy.

949
01:9:51,959-->01:9:53,720
I have been ordered to manage affairs of the Harem.

950
01:9:53,800-->01:9:58,119
I shall help you to keep the unborn child of Concubine An from all harm.

951
01:9:58,199-->01:10:1,880
It is a fine thing that Noble Consort Xi understands the importance of this.

952
01:10:1,960-->01:10:4,159
Your Majesty, Concubine An is weak.

953
01:10:5,79-->01:10:8,279
To assure a stable pregnancy and to soothe Concubine An,

954
01:10:8,359-->01:10:11,319
I request that Concubine An be promoted to the rank of Consort.

955
01:10:11,399-->01:10:16,319
There ought to be four Consorts, but–

956
01:10:16,399-->01:10:18,600
It is for the benefit of the imperial line.

957
01:10:18,680-->01:10:21,680
If she is not ranked as Consort, a discussion will be raised,

958
01:10:21,760-->01:10:23,920
saying she was implicated by her father.

959
01:10:24,0-->01:10:27,640
This would greatly perturb her. How could she attend to her pregnancy?

960
01:10:32,439-->01:10:34,920
News of the grand conferment of all concubines has spread widely.

961
01:10:36,199-->01:10:38,359
Once the Empress proposed conferring Concubine An as Consort Li,

962
01:10:38,439-->01:10:41,759
you immediately suggested the grand conferment of all concubines.

963
01:10:41,839-->01:10:44,960
They will all be grateful to you, my lady.

964
01:10:45,119-->01:10:48,79
I do not wish to let the Empress do all the good deeds.

965
01:10:48,240-->01:10:51,520
She wished to elevate An Lingrong. Why should I not take advantage of it?

966
01:10:52,359-->01:10:54,239
We shall share the benefits.

967
01:10:54,319-->01:10:57,439
Zhen Huan gains the advantage from the conferment of all concubines,

968
01:10:57,520-->01:11:0,720
- but it will not last long. - You are wise, Your Highness.

969
01:11:1,960-->01:11:3,840
Is the medicine for pregnancy sent on schedule?

970
01:11:3,919-->01:11:7,760
The best medicine, as you ordered, Your Highness.

971
01:11:7,840-->01:11:9,39
Last night, the doctor reported

972
01:11:9,640-->01:11:13,239
that smoked mugwort leaves were used to steady Consort Li's pregnancy.

973
01:11:13,319-->01:11:15,800
Mugwort leaves are already needed in the fourth month?

974
01:11:15,880-->01:11:18,199
Consort Li is having a difficult time.

975
01:11:18,279-->01:11:22,120
She is fortunate enough to carry an imperial baby even for a few months.

976
01:11:22,199-->01:11:25,159
Tell the imperial doctor

977
01:11:25,239-->01:11:28,960
that her pregnancy must appear normal, cost what it may.

978
01:11:29,39-->01:11:30,39
Yes, Your Highness.

979
01:11:30,960-->01:11:33,399
This fan with white jade handle is very effective.

980
01:11:33,479-->01:11:36,40
With it in your hand, you won't even notice the heat.

981
01:11:36,720-->01:11:39,399
This red gemstone is uncut

982
01:11:39,479-->01:11:41,800
and can be embedded in your coronet by a craftsman.

983
01:11:43,119-->01:11:45,439
I cannot receive such treasures from you, my lady.

984
01:11:45,520-->01:11:48,40
You are His Majesty's most precious treasure.

985
01:11:48,119-->01:11:51,239
Only the finest of treasures will suit you.

986
01:11:53,920-->01:11:57,0
Is the imperial doctor who attends to Consort Li's pregnancy present?

987
01:11:57,80-->01:12:0,119
Yes, Noble Consort Xi. It is Doctor Xu.

988
01:12:0,720-->01:12:2,880
I bow before Noble Consort Xi.

989
01:12:2,960-->01:12:6,799
Consort Li is now with child. You must be extremely cautious.

990
01:12:7,600-->01:12:9,640
As the Empress said,

991
01:12:9,720-->01:12:12,680
see to it that she does not lose her child as I once did.

992
01:12:12,759-->01:12:17,840
Not only are my gifts to be examined, but all the other gifts as well.

993
01:12:18,560-->01:12:20,600
You speak of yourself as an outsider.

994
01:12:20,680-->01:12:23,279
If I ever had reason to suspect you, I would–

995
01:12:23,359-->01:12:25,319
Nonsense! Say no more of the taboo.

996
01:12:26,0-->01:12:29,39
I do it for our friendship.

997
01:12:30,360-->01:12:34,240
If someone wishes to play a trick, it will be impossible to seize the chance.

998
01:12:34,319-->01:12:36,479
- In fact– - This is Doctor Wei.

999
01:12:36,560-->01:12:39,279
It is more secure if two imperial doctors examine the gifts together.

1000
01:12:52,199-->01:12:56,720
My lady, nothing harmful to pregnancy has been placed among these gifts.

1001
01:12:56,800-->01:12:58,119
Correct.

1002
01:12:58,960-->01:13:1,520
Then we can be relieved.

1003
01:13:3,160-->01:13:6,439
You don't conceive easily, so you must take extra care.

1004
01:13:7,40-->01:13:9,920
Doctor Xu, how fares Consort Li?

1005
01:13:10,0-->01:13:12,839
Her pregnancy is stable, my lady.

1006
01:13:13,680-->01:13:17,719
It may be noted from her good complexion.

1007
01:13:17,800-->01:13:20,79
Her fondness for fragrances is not a problem, is it?

1008
01:13:20,159-->01:13:22,79
Not at all.

1009
01:13:24,640-->01:13:26,399
You are an expert on fragrances.

1010
01:13:26,479-->01:13:29,279
What is the fragrance you use today?

1011
01:13:29,360-->01:13:31,39
It is Ninglu Incense.

1012
01:13:31,119-->01:13:34,520
If you like it, I shall give some to you.

1013
01:13:35,399-->01:13:40,79
Baojuan, fetch some Ninglu Incense for Noble Consort Xi.

1014
01:13:40,159-->01:13:41,800
Yes, my lady.

1015
01:13:42,80-->01:13:43,680
How could I trouble your servants?

1016
01:13:44,439-->01:13:47,79
Xiao Yunzi, follow Baojuan to fetch the fragrance.

1017
01:13:47,160-->01:13:48,399
Yes, my lady.

1018
01:13:54,640-->01:13:56,479
While fetching the Ninglu Incense,

1019
01:13:56,560-->01:13:58,680
I saw several fragrance boxes at the top of a shelf.

1020
01:13:58,760-->01:14:1,160
I was told Consort Li liked them no more and kept them there.

1021
01:14:1,239-->01:14:5,159
But as the boxes looked refined, they did not seem to be abandoned.

1022
01:14:5,240-->01:14:8,279
I caught Baojuan off-guard and opened a box to obtain some.

1023
01:14:8,520-->01:14:10,920
It looks like fragrant beeswax.

1024
01:14:14,760-->01:14:17,800
The scent is odd. What is it?

1025
01:14:21,920-->01:14:25,520
Noble Consort Xi claims to be ill and refuses to see me.

1026
01:14:26,239-->01:14:31,359
For the moment, I can't impute the loss of my child to her.

1027
01:14:31,960-->01:14:33,199
You must be patient.

1028
01:14:34,720-->01:14:38,40
The imperial doctor told me you mustn't keep the child any longer than six months.

1029
01:14:38,840-->01:14:42,600
You must abort the child or you will die.

1030
01:14:43,960-->01:14:47,719
You still have over a month to consider.

1031
01:14:50,199-->01:14:51,320
I know, Your Highness.

1032
01:14:53,479-->01:14:55,79
You are wise, my lady.

1033
01:14:55,159-->01:14:59,319
Consort Li used fragrance to conceal the smell of mugwort leaves,

1034
01:14:59,399-->01:15:2,199
but I detected it.

1035
01:15:3,359-->01:15:5,879
Consort Li is using mugwort leaves in the fourth month,

1036
01:15:5,960-->01:15:7,920
which is a sign of bleeding.

1037
01:15:8,0-->01:15:10,79
Consort Li has poor chi and blood circulation,

1038
01:15:10,159-->01:15:12,39
symptoms of night sweats and miscarriage.

1039
01:15:12,119-->01:15:14,360
She will not carry the child to full term.

1040
01:15:17,119-->01:15:18,960
You and I both know it.

1041
01:15:19,40-->01:15:22,760
I will not be held responsible.

1042
01:15:25,560-->01:15:28,239
Tell me what this is.

1043
01:15:44,399-->01:15:45,439
Jinxi!

1044
01:15:51,599-->01:15:54,39
Forgive me, my lady. I was too incautious,

1045
01:15:54,120-->01:15:56,0
for I overlooked the effect of this fragrance.

1046
01:15:56,80-->01:15:57,80
What is it?

1047
01:15:59,199-->01:16:2,79
Couples use it for passionate desires.

1048
01:16:3,160-->01:16:6,359
It can achieve such a strong effect just by slightly dissolving in water.

1049
01:16:6,439-->01:16:7,640
You may not be aware,

1050
01:16:7,720-->01:16:12,239
but it contains a large amount of ilang-ilang and Cnidium fruit.

1051
01:16:12,319-->01:16:15,999
It becomes even stronger when burned.

1052
01:16:16,80-->01:16:17,680
When masked by other fragrances,

1053
01:16:17,760-->01:16:22,520
a small amount can produce an effect without being detected.

1054
01:16:31,960-->01:16:35,120
The young mistress likes peach blossoms. Why are these lilies sent instead?

1055
01:16:35,720-->01:16:39,399
The gardeners in the greenhouse say that lilies can ease the mind,

1056
01:16:39,479-->01:16:43,199
so we were commanded to pick them and bring them to your palace.

1057
01:16:50,40-->01:16:53,760
My lady, lilies do ease the mind.

1058
01:16:53,840-->01:16:55,439
You're troubled by insomnia and fitful sleep.

1059
01:16:55,520-->01:16:57,920
Lilies will do you good indeed.

1060
01:16:59,800-->01:17:2,680
- Then put them over there. - Yes, my lady.

1061
01:17:12,439-->01:17:15,160
- Have the lilies been sent? - Yes, my lady.

1062
01:17:15,239-->01:17:16,960
The greenhouse sends them every day.

1063
01:17:17,40-->01:17:21,520
The doctor says the buds cause no harm. Consort Li also likes them.

1064
01:17:22,159-->01:17:24,439
It will be her birthday in a few days.

1065
01:17:24,520-->01:17:27,399
His Majesty will keep her company. No need for us to worry.

1066
01:17:28,239-->01:17:31,800
Do not worry, my lady. You shall feign illness and do nothing.

1067
01:17:31,880-->01:17:33,79
I must avoid her,

1068
01:17:33,680-->01:17:37,640
for the burden will be too much if she blames me for the loss of her baby.

1069
01:17:41,640-->01:17:44,439
Oh, my! Music has been playing all day long.

1070
01:17:44,919-->01:17:47,319
Yanxi Palace is filled with joy.

1071
01:17:48,119-->01:17:51,920
Surely it is, for she celebrates her birthday while carrying a child.

1072
01:17:54,479-->01:17:58,439
I arranged these flowers myself. Aren't they beautiful?

1073
01:17:58,520-->01:17:59,600
Truly, my lady.

1074
01:17:59,680-->01:18:3,640
The greenhouse shall send them to Yanxi Palace.

1075
01:18:6,159-->01:18:9,439
Once delivered, be sure to water the buds often

1076
01:18:10,359-->01:18:12,759
to keep them fresh.

1077
01:18:17,160-->01:18:20,840
After rushing about for the entire day,

1078
01:18:20,920-->01:18:24,239
at last I have a moment of peace to talk and drink with you.

1079
01:18:25,479-->01:18:27,399
I thought you liked scenes of excitement.

1080
01:18:27,479-->01:18:29,160
I do.

1081
01:18:30,360-->01:18:32,760
But I prefer spending time with you.

1082
01:18:37,120-->01:18:39,239
You smell wonderful.

1083
01:18:39,759-->01:18:44,439
Your Majesty, the imperial doctor said that intimacy is not advisable.

1084
01:18:45,39-->01:18:48,520
It's the fifth month. I assume it's safe.

1085
01:18:48,600-->01:18:53,120
- But the imperial doctor said– - You do not wish me to stay with you?

1086
01:19:4,159-->01:19:7,159
My ladies, I bear bad news. Consort Li has lost the baby.

1087
01:19:9,399-->01:19:11,560
It matters not. Why are you so nervous?

1088
01:19:11,640-->01:19:15,520
Consort Jing, Consort Li miscarried because she and His Majesty were–

1089
01:19:16,719-->01:19:19,359
- Young mistress! - Why is she bleeding profusely?

1090
01:19:19,439-->01:19:20,960
Hold on, young mistress.

1091
01:19:22,680-->01:19:24,200
My baby!

1092
01:19:24,279-->01:19:25,840
How is Consort Li?

1093
01:19:26,680-->01:19:30,760
With so much bleeding, the baby is lost for sure.

1094
01:19:31,479-->01:19:34,359
Vigorous sexual intercourse should not be undertaken during pregnancy.

1095
01:19:34,439-->01:19:37,319
They should have refrained from it.

1096
01:19:37,399-->01:19:39,0
Besides, she–

1097
01:19:47,359-->01:19:48,840
How is she?

1098
01:19:49,439-->01:19:51,239
She is bleeding profusely.

1099
01:19:51,320-->01:19:55,359
The imperial doctor says she will lose the baby.

1100
01:19:56,560-->01:19:57,880
I am at fault.

1101
01:19:59,160-->01:20:0,639
It is all my fault.

1102
01:20:2,40-->01:20:3,79
The baby is lost.

1103
01:20:5,560-->01:20:6,560
Huan Huan,

1104
01:20:9,39-->01:20:11,159
I have lost another child.

1105
01:20:12,0-->01:20:13,640
It was merely an accident, Your Majesty.

1106
01:20:13,720-->01:20:15,880
It was not.

1107
01:20:17,160-->01:20:19,240
Perhaps it was the wine.

1108
01:20:22,279-->01:20:25,79
Consort Li has been defeated.

1109
01:20:25,159-->01:20:27,359
It is suspicious how she lost the baby.

1110
01:20:27,439-->01:20:30,160
The imperial doctor warned her against intimacy with His Majesty.

1111
01:20:30,239-->01:20:33,560
- Why did she do so knowingly? - It was His Majesty who did so knowingly.

1112
01:20:34,720-->01:20:37,600
Yet why couldn't he control himself?

1113
01:20:38,279-->01:20:41,439
This Ninglu Incense of Consort Li is a treasure indeed.

1114
01:20:41,520-->01:20:46,199
Fresh and clean as if flowers were blossoming. It is truly precious.

1115
01:20:46,919-->01:20:52,199
Anyone with even a little of it can win His Majesty's heart.

1116
01:20:52,959-->01:20:54,239
What on earth is this?

1117
01:20:54,319-->01:20:56,359
Your Highness,

1118
01:20:56,439-->01:20:58,359
love is not necessary in intimate relations

1119
01:20:58,439-->01:21:0,800
if aphrodisiac fragrance is utilized.

1120
01:21:3,279-->01:21:7,560
Was it truly obtained from Consort Li?

1121
01:21:8,359-->01:21:13,479
Your Highness, I have no reason to malign her.

1122
01:21:14,399-->01:21:17,880
The day Consort Li miscarried, I found it quite suspicious.

1123
01:21:17,960-->01:21:19,760
The Emperor can handle his drink.

1124
01:21:19,840-->01:21:23,120
It is quite impossible for him to lose control after having so little.

1125
01:21:23,200-->01:21:25,439
His Majesty knew that she was pregnant.

1126
01:21:25,520-->01:21:27,680
Even if he did desire intercourse,

1127
01:21:28,359-->01:21:30,399
he would never be so reckless.

1128
01:21:30,479-->01:21:33,240
How could he not know the importance?

1129
01:21:33,319-->01:21:35,560
Consort Li also knew it.

1130
01:21:35,640-->01:21:37,560
Why did she not restrain him?

1131
01:21:37,640-->01:21:40,39
Therefore, I sent someone to investigate.

1132
01:21:40,120-->01:21:45,39
This was found among the incense ashes that Baojuan disposed of.

1133
01:21:46,640-->01:21:51,79
Consort Li has been sufficiently punished with the loss of her child.

1134
01:21:51,159-->01:21:52,720
It is quite enough.

1135
01:21:53,40-->01:21:56,640
But she dared beguile His Majesty with this ruse and tarnished the Harem.

1136
01:21:57,319-->01:21:59,360
She shall not be spared.

1137
01:21:59,439-->01:22:2,439
Consort Li is indeed guilty of mixing aphrodisiac fragrances,

1138
01:22:2,520-->01:22:5,560
but she has already lost her child and can no longer conceive.

1139
01:22:6,279-->01:22:8,0
She has been punished enough.

1140
01:22:8,640-->01:22:11,39
Your Majesty, please forgive her this time.

1141
01:22:12,199-->01:22:16,160
Moreover, her fragrances are of great benefit.

1142
01:22:17,439-->01:22:19,760
Some time ago, my face was scratched by a cat.

1143
01:22:19,840-->01:22:22,399
Consort Li gave me this healing balm.

1144
01:22:22,479-->01:22:25,520
It was very effective and no scarring remained.

1145
01:22:26,640-->01:22:31,239
Your Majesty, please consider her merits and forgive her this time.

1146
01:22:31,840-->01:22:37,279
You were scratched by the cat during your first pregnancy, weren't you?

1147
01:22:37,359-->01:22:38,640
Yes, my lady.

1148
01:22:39,399-->01:22:41,200
Why do you ask, my lady?

1149
01:22:43,80-->01:22:44,80
Your Majesty,

1150
01:22:44,839-->01:22:47,999
I do not have the good fortune to conceive because of my debility.

1151
01:22:48,79-->01:22:52,319
What Noble Consort Xi has said recalls something to my mind.

1152
01:22:52,399-->01:22:55,39
Noble Consort Xi was healthy back then.

1153
01:22:55,120-->01:22:56,800
Even though Nian Shilan spited her,

1154
01:22:56,880-->01:23:0,239
it was unthinkable that she should lose the baby after kneeling only half an hour.

1155
01:23:0,319-->01:23:2,680
In hindsight, was it not suspicious?

1156
01:23:5,40-->01:23:8,879
A healthy person is no match for a wicked plot.

1157
01:23:8,959-->01:23:10,239
Where is Wei Lin?

1158
01:23:10,319-->01:23:13,680
He is waiting outside to take your pulse, Your Majesty.

1159
01:23:13,760-->01:23:15,479
Send him in.

1160
01:23:23,679-->01:23:26,119
Musk was added to it, Your Majesty.

1161
01:23:27,280-->01:23:29,520
If applied to the face daily,

1162
01:23:29,600-->01:23:31,840
miscarriage will occur within three months.

1163
01:23:32,880-->01:23:34,399
It cannot be!

1164
01:23:34,999-->01:23:38,959
- Lingrong killed my child! - There is no mistaking it.

1165
01:23:39,39-->01:23:40,520
The balm in this container is now dry.

1166
01:23:40,600-->01:23:42,479
I gather it has not been used for some time.

1167
01:23:42,839-->01:23:45,960
It would take at least two containers to remove the scars.

1168
01:23:47,199-->01:23:50,399
With such a dosage, miscarriage is certain.

1169
01:23:52,120-->01:23:55,279
Your Majesty!

1170
01:23:58,119-->01:24:1,80
Lingrong is heartless.

1171
01:24:3,719-->01:24:8,159
It was An Lingrong's maid who adversely affected Mei's pregnancy.

1172
01:24:8,239-->01:24:10,880
Now we all know that she has evil intentions.

1173
01:24:10,959-->01:24:14,439
The maid must have been sent by An Lingrong.

1174
01:24:14,520-->01:24:17,960
It is a great pity for Princess Jinghe to be left motherless.

1175
01:24:18,240-->01:24:20,560
I wonder how An Lingrong feels

1176
01:24:20,640-->01:24:23,879
whenever she faces Princess Jinghe.

1177
01:24:25,560-->01:24:27,80
Wonderful.

1178
01:24:28,560-->01:24:30,160
Truly wonderful.

1179
01:24:31,279-->01:24:34,399
The woman I have loved for years turns out to be a devil.

1180
01:24:37,279-->01:24:38,679
Your Majesty.

1181
01:24:38,760-->01:24:42,759
We found these objects at the palace of Consort Li.

1182
01:24:54,560-->01:24:56,479
This musk is rich in fragrance.

1183
01:24:57,119-->01:25:0,560
This kind is extremely rare and produces an intense effect.

1184
01:25:0,639-->01:25:3,240
Who knows how many people have lost their lives because of it?

1185
01:25:3,840-->01:25:6,79
Dispose of it all quickly.

1186
01:25:8,959-->01:25:12,640
Were Noble Consort Xi's child and Shen Meizhuang both lost

1187
01:25:12,720-->01:25:14,680
because of what you did?

1188
01:25:14,760-->01:25:18,840
When I first plotted against them, I knew it would come to this.

1189
01:25:19,560-->01:25:20,999
Consort Li,

1190
01:25:21,799-->01:25:23,800
you have been by my side for years

1191
01:25:23,879-->01:25:26,439
and have never disobeyed me once.

1192
01:25:27,39-->01:25:29,439
How could you be so vicious behind my back?

1193
01:25:30,39-->01:25:32,960
Have you ever liked me, Your Majesty?

1194
01:25:35,479-->01:25:37,79
You have treated me

1195
01:25:37,800-->01:25:41,720
as if I were a docile pet.

1196
01:25:43,520-->01:25:45,520
I am vicious, you say.

1197
01:25:46,439-->01:25:48,240
But in the Imperial Harem,

1198
01:25:48,999-->01:25:51,79
who among us has never been vicious?

1199
01:25:52,399-->01:25:55,399
When the moment comes, everyone is vicious.

1200
01:25:55,479-->01:25:57,640
In this palace,

1201
01:25:57,720-->01:25:59,800
no one acts of her own accord.

1202
01:25:59,880-->01:26:4,399
But you are much more vicious than the others.

1203
01:26:6,359-->01:26:7,680
I will not order your death.

1204
01:26:9,120-->01:26:12,159
I will even preserve your title as Consort Li.

1205
01:26:13,0-->01:26:16,279
Yanxi Palace shall be your Cold Palace.

1206
01:26:17,160-->01:26:19,199
After you have recovered,

1207
01:26:20,240-->01:26:23,600
your face will be slapped every day,

1208
01:26:23,679-->01:26:27,880
and you shall kneel before the Buddha to atone for your sins.

1209
01:26:28,680-->01:26:33,199
You shall be a warning to others so no one will commit such evil deeds again.

1210
01:26:44,520-->01:26:46,119
This incense

1211
01:26:47,399-->01:26:49,960
is dedicated to my first unborn child.

1212
01:26:51,199-->01:26:54,359
He can now be at peace in heaven.

1213
01:26:56,920-->01:26:59,39
The color of the blossoms

1214
01:27:0,39-->01:27:1,960
is exactly the same as that of the aphrodisiac fragrance.

1215
01:27:2,40-->01:27:3,319
Yes, my lady.

1216
01:27:3,919-->01:27:6,159
The fragrance that Xiao Yunzi found by accident

1217
01:27:6,239-->01:27:9,359
turned out to be key to the downfall of An Lingrong.

1218
01:27:10,640-->01:27:13,520
The servants from the greenhouse delivered foxtail lilies every day,

1219
01:27:14,160-->01:27:16,399
but no one knew that the buds for that very night

1220
01:27:17,600-->01:27:22,319
were watered with aphrodisiac fragrances.

1221
01:27:23,760-->01:27:26,640
An Lingrong is an expert in fragrances,

1222
01:27:27,239-->01:27:31,199
yet those same fragrances have dug a grave for her.

1223
01:27:31,800-->01:27:32,840
Su Peisheng says

1224
01:27:33,479-->01:27:36,760
he will take good care of her at Yanxi Palace.

1225
01:27:41,720-->01:27:45,0
Sister, let's see who can fly a kite higher.

1226
01:27:45,80-->01:27:46,760
Hearing the word "sister,"

1227
01:27:46,840-->01:27:50,999
I thought it was Lingrong calling out to me,

1228
01:27:51,79-->01:27:53,720
or myself calling out to Mei.

1229
01:27:55,79-->01:27:57,239
Yet we can never turn back the clock.

1230
01:27:57,319-->01:28:0,39
This fathomless palace

1231
01:28:0,119-->01:28:4,359
has destroyed our friendships and family ties.

1232
01:28:4,439-->01:28:7,399
Every last one of us becomes a vicious monster,

1233
01:28:8,0-->01:28:11,39
determined to kill the others.

1234
01:28:11,119-->01:28:16,160
My friends and enemies have left me, one by one.

1235
01:28:16,760-->01:28:19,199
At the end of all these struggles,

1236
01:28:19,279-->01:28:24,359
at last I realize that my true enemy has always been the demon within me.
