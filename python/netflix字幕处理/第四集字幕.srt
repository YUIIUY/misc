00:01:57,519-->00:02:04,239
Empresses in the Palace

2
00:02:05,480-->00:02:11,600
Episode 4

3
00:02:13,0-->00:02:14,919
I bow before the Empress Dowager.

4
00:02:15,0-->00:02:20,839
His Majesty sends you a prayer bracelet of agilawood, offered in tribute.

5
00:02:20,919-->00:02:24,920
Its fragrance soothes the nerves and eases the mind, a fine treasure indeed.

6
00:02:28,879-->00:02:33,159
This Buddhist prayer bracelet calls Ganlu Temple to mind.

7
00:02:33,240-->00:02:38,279
Who would expect a spiritual temple to be involved in worldly affairs?

8
00:02:38,360-->00:02:41,199
It is merely another venue for the contest of powers.

9
00:02:41,280-->00:02:43,639
I suffered greatly there.

10
00:02:44,440-->00:02:47,960
Yet, "In misfortune lies the seed of happiness."

11
00:02:48,39-->00:02:50,320
Those days at Ganlu Temple,

12
00:02:50,400-->00:02:54,840
were the happiest of my life.

13
00:02:55,719-->00:02:57,839
How is Mei's wound?

14
00:02:58,439-->00:03:00,0
Much improved, my lady.

15
00:03:00,80-->00:03:02,439
Lady Hui's wound was slow in healing,

16
00:03:02,520-->00:03:05,320
but she had fully recovered before summer arrived.

17
00:03:05,400-->00:03:08,599
Only a pale scar remains.

18
00:03:08,680-->00:03:12,80
A scar? Did she not use the balm?

19
00:03:13,280-->00:03:16,360
Something was put in the balm.

20
00:03:19,479-->00:03:21,80
Musk.

21
00:03:23,479-->00:03:26,600
There was musk in the balm, wasn't there?

22
00:03:27,199-->00:03:28,199
Yes, my lady.

23
00:03:29,319-->00:03:32,560
The balm contained a fair amount of musk.

24
00:03:32,639-->00:03:35,40
If musk is absorbed into the skin through a wound,

25
00:03:35,119-->00:03:37,519
the abortive effect is the same as if it were directly ingested.

26
00:03:37,599-->00:03:39,599
Moreover, the balm has a rich floral fragrance

27
00:03:39,679-->00:03:41,919
designed to conceal the smell of the musk.

28
00:03:42,680-->00:03:45,639
Only an expert in fragrances could have mixed it.

29
00:03:47,279-->00:03:48,800
- Young mistress! - My lady!

30
00:03:48,879-->00:03:51,319
My lady, are you ill?

31
00:03:51,919-->00:03:53,919
Human nature sickens me more.

32
00:03:55,840-->00:03:58,720
Does Mei know this?

33
00:03:59,879-->00:04:01,479
I dare not speak of it lightly.

34
00:04:02,80-->00:04:04,240
She must know nothing of this.

35
00:04:05,919-->00:04:10,319
If An Lingrong is truly behind this, she is masterful in her guile.

36
00:04:12,80-->00:04:16,240
I find myself in desperate straits while Mei is alone and powerless.

37
00:04:18,519-->00:04:20,560
Be sure to tell Mei

38
00:04:21,680-->00:04:25,199
not to fall afoul of the Empress and An Lingrong.

39
00:04:28,40-->00:04:30,0
GOOD FORTUNE

40
00:04:31,360-->00:04:33,399
Your Highness, Concubine Huan is bleeding profusely.

41
00:04:33,480-->00:04:35,279
The child may come too soon.

42
00:04:36,79-->00:04:39,319
Caiyue, hurry! Send for a sedan chair. I must go to Suiyu Pavilion.

43
00:04:39,399-->00:04:41,800
- Yes, my lady. - Do not go.

44
00:04:41,879-->00:04:45,160
I must. Huan is in labor. I must be at her side.

45
00:04:45,240-->00:04:46,680
Now is not the time.

46
00:04:46,759-->00:04:50,999
His Majesty must see that Concubine Huan risks her life for his child.

47
00:04:51,79-->00:04:54,0
Then she will always be present in His Majesty's thoughts.

48
00:04:54,79-->00:04:56,920
Only in this way can Concubine Huan regain His Majesty's favor.

49
00:04:57,520-->00:04:59,319
Then I will request his presence.

50
00:05:00,399-->00:05:03,279
Mei, His Majesty must go of his own accord.

51
00:05:04,680-->00:05:06,920
With all your strength, my lady!

52
00:05:06,999-->00:05:08,720
The head can be seen.

53
00:05:08,799-->00:05:10,640
Push, my lady!

54
00:05:10,720-->00:05:13,800
- My lady, push! - Push harder!

55
00:05:13,880-->00:05:16,440
The head can be seen. My lady, push!

56
00:05:16,519-->00:05:19,199
- Harder, my lady! - With all your strength!

57
00:05:31,40-->00:05:33,879
Your Majesty, please do not worry.

58
00:05:35,480-->00:05:36,920
At last!

59
00:05:36,999-->00:05:38,799
Your Majesty, the baby is born.

60
00:05:38,879-->00:05:41,239
Congratulations, Your Majesty! It is a princess.

61
00:05:43,79-->00:05:45,680
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

62
00:05:45,759-->00:05:48,720
A princess is good, too.

63
00:05:48,800-->00:05:50,760
We will visit Concubine Huan.

64
00:05:50,839-->00:05:54,759
Your Majesty, you are beaming. She is not even your first princess.

65
00:05:54,839-->00:05:57,560
Only a princess. Nothing to be delighted about.

66
00:05:58,160-->00:06:01,759
Your Majesty, you cannot hide the smile on your face.

67
00:06:05,720-->00:06:08,759
- You may rise. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

68
00:06:12,199-->00:06:13,520
Concubine Huan.

69
00:06:14,480-->00:06:17,880
You have given me a princess.

70
00:06:17,959-->00:06:19,240
Are you still angry with me?

71
00:06:19,320-->00:06:23,319
If you wish, I can issue an imperial decree tomorrow

72
00:06:23,399-->00:06:25,360
to grant you the rank of Consort.

73
00:06:28,79-->00:06:32,320
Your Majesty, do you still believe we can return to the way it was?

74
00:06:45,559-->00:06:49,840
I have spoiled you indeed.

75
00:06:51,839-->00:06:56,399
With such a disposition, you are not fit to stay in the palace.

76
00:06:58,360-->00:07:01,600
Calm your mind at the temple. You cannot live here any longer.

77
00:07:02,360-->00:07:04,559
As a person of ill omen,

78
00:07:04,639-->00:07:07,200
I dare not disturb the peace of the palace.

79
00:07:07,920-->00:07:09,879
Thank you, Your Majesty.

80
00:07:09,959-->00:07:13,679
You shall leave soon. Do not stay in the palace any longer.

81
00:07:18,559-->00:07:19,959
My lady.

82
00:07:20,800-->00:07:22,319
Young mistress.

83
00:07:27,520-->00:07:29,119
I have but one request to make.

84
00:07:30,440-->00:07:31,680
Speak.

85
00:07:31,759-->00:07:33,519
After my departure,

86
00:07:34,120-->00:07:36,480
I hope Consort Jing will raise my princess.

87
00:07:38,360-->00:07:42,360
If you could grant that, I would have nothing more to worry about.

88
00:07:44,440-->00:07:47,79
Consort Duan has adopted Princess Wenyi,

89
00:07:47,160-->00:07:49,840
and Consort Jing can be trusted.

90
00:07:51,120-->00:07:52,759
Born in this dim moonlight,

91
00:07:54,319-->00:07:57,839
she shall be granted the honorific name of Longyue.

92
00:07:58,480-->00:08:02,839
All princesses are granted an honorific name after the first month of life.

93
00:08:03,639-->00:08:07,199
Longyue is honored to be granted one shortly after birth.

94
00:08:08,40-->00:08:09,800
Thank you for your gracious concern, Your Majesty.

95
00:08:12,199-->00:08:14,559
Have you nothing else to tell me?

96
00:08:28,480-->00:08:31,799
Very well. So be it.

97
00:08:32,559-->00:08:35,520
Since you are resolved to leave,

98
00:08:36,399-->00:08:38,279
I have nothing more to say.

99
00:08:38,879-->00:08:44,359
Consort Jing and I will raise Longyue well.

100
00:08:50,600-->00:08:52,119
Huan,

101
00:08:53,719-->00:08:56,39
is this the only way out?

102
00:08:56,120-->00:08:58,360
If I stay here even one more day,

103
00:08:59,240-->00:09:01,600
the princess will be in greater danger.

104
00:09:03,320-->00:09:04,919
From now on,

105
00:09:05,960-->00:09:09,399
you will be a mother to the princess.

106
00:09:17,200-->00:09:20,760
I entrust her to your care.

107
00:09:21,359-->00:09:22,960
I am well aware

108
00:09:23,39-->00:09:25,320
that you could have entrusted any other with this child,

109
00:09:26,159-->00:09:29,119
but you have shown me compassion, for I have no child of my own.

110
00:09:31,479-->00:09:34,480
Please leave, or I won't be able to bear losing her.

111
00:09:58,440-->00:10:01,320
Huan, it is not all bad,

112
00:10:02,679-->00:10:05,639
for now you are freed from this place.

113
00:10:05,720-->00:10:07,639
As long as you remain in the palace,

114
00:10:08,440-->00:10:10,600
you must beware of the Empress and An Lingrong.

115
00:10:12,480-->00:10:14,480
Don't be swayed by resentment on my account.

116
00:10:15,159-->00:10:18,519
- Be at peace and take care of yourself. - I will.

117
00:10:19,559-->00:10:22,960
Doctor Wen, Mei has no one else.

118
00:10:23,39-->00:10:24,639
I entrust her to you.

119
00:10:24,720-->00:10:26,559
Do not fall into any traps.

120
00:10:28,200-->00:10:30,960
Please take care as well, Concubine Huan.

121
00:10:52,399-->00:10:55,519
The imperial decree says you shall not shave your hair.

122
00:10:56,600-->00:11:00,200
You are now one of us, not a noble lady of the palace.

123
00:11:00,840-->00:11:04,39
You must abstain from worldly life and abandon your original name.

124
00:11:04,120-->00:11:05,119
JING'AN

125
00:11:06,120-->00:11:09,520
You shall be of the Mo class, just as my disciples.

126
00:11:13,0-->00:11:16,320
There is a hint of melancholy on your face,

127
00:11:16,400-->00:11:18,919
and so you shall be called Mochou.

128
00:11:21,359-->00:11:24,239
That is very thoughtful of you, Abbess. I accept with all my heart.

129
00:11:29,320-->00:11:33,80
Here we are. You may tidy it up yourselves.

130
00:11:40,240-->00:11:41,720
Please sit down, madam.

131
00:11:43,200-->00:11:46,159
Please take a seat, mistress. I will unpack the clothes.

132
00:11:46,240-->00:11:47,519
No need to unpack.

133
00:11:48,159-->00:11:50,720
Merely a few changes of clothes.

134
00:11:50,799-->00:11:52,960
Mistress, you've been given a special Buddhist name.

135
00:11:53,39-->00:11:56,39
"Mochou" seems quite peculiar,

136
00:11:56,120-->00:11:58,399
like the name of a young lady from a wealthy family.

137
00:11:58,480-->00:12:00,399
The Abbess tries to warn me

138
00:12:01,320-->00:12:03,80
that I am now a nun

139
00:12:03,720-->00:12:07,39
and should no longer pay heed to worldly concerns.

140
00:12:24,80-->00:12:25,719
Be quick, now!

141
00:12:26,399-->00:12:27,840
Quickly!

142
00:12:27,919-->00:12:30,159
Mopping the floor is torture.

143
00:12:30,239-->00:12:33,119
You can't straighten up or raise your head.

144
00:12:33,200-->00:12:34,800
Worse still, the main hall is enormous.

145
00:12:34,879-->00:12:38,919
After several hours of work, you will be completely worn out.

146
00:12:39,0-->00:12:43,880
- Jingbai always plays tricks. - Absolutely.

147
00:13:05,0-->00:13:07,399
Jinxi, I'm fine.

148
00:13:07,479-->00:13:09,80
It is I.

149
00:13:14,320-->00:13:15,320
Marquess Guo!

150
00:13:15,399-->00:13:18,760
This is no place for conversation. I would like a word with you.

151
00:13:23,840-->00:13:26,880
Two days ago, I saw someone in the palace,

152
00:13:26,960-->00:13:29,80
and I painted a portrait of her.

153
00:13:29,679-->00:13:32,840
Please give me your remarks and advise me.

154
00:13:33,440-->00:13:37,200
I am no expert in painting, how could I advise you?

155
00:13:42,359-->00:13:44,519
This is Consort Jing.

156
00:13:46,519-->00:13:48,119
This is Mei.

157
00:13:51,480-->00:13:52,720
This is--

158
00:13:54,0-->00:13:57,240
I painted it when I first saw Princess Longyue

159
00:13:57,320-->00:13:59,320
to show goodwill as her royal uncle.

160
00:14:02,959-->00:14:04,720
In such a short time,

161
00:14:06,39-->00:14:08,240
Longyue has grown much.

162
00:14:09,399-->00:14:11,360
Children always grow fast.

163
00:14:11,960-->00:14:15,759
It is said that Princess Longyue will soon be one year old.

164
00:14:15,840-->00:14:18,80
You are her birth mother,

165
00:14:18,159-->00:14:20,679
so I thought you might want to know how she was.

166
00:14:24,200-->00:14:27,719
Your painting tells me all I could ever wish to know.

167
00:14:28,759-->00:14:30,360
Thank you for your kindness, my lord.

168
00:14:35,600-->00:14:38,840
In front of you is Mount Piaomiao where my pavilion is located.

169
00:14:40,320-->00:14:43,360
Each month I stay there for some 10 days.

170
00:14:43,440-->00:14:47,480
Do inform me if you are in need of anything.

171
00:14:48,159-->00:14:49,640
I will do all I can.

172
00:14:51,39-->00:14:53,39
I am filled with gratitude for Longyue's portrait.

173
00:14:53,120-->00:14:55,760
I have nothing more to ask for.

174
00:14:57,519-->00:15:00,120
Your Majesty, the princess turns one today.

175
00:15:00,200-->00:15:02,120
You have drunk much for this happy occasion.

176
00:15:02,720-->00:15:04,519
Please return and rest.

177
00:15:04,599-->00:15:07,200
I shall escort you to Yangxin Hall.

178
00:15:07,279-->00:15:11,80
- We have reached Suiyu Pavilion. - Lady Hui will soon live here.

179
00:15:11,159-->00:15:12,840
Lady Hui?

180
00:15:12,919-->00:15:15,120
It was bestowed upon Lady Hui by the Empress Dowager.

181
00:15:15,200-->00:15:16,799
In two days she will move in.

182
00:15:16,879-->00:15:19,599
- Then I will enter. - Yes, Your Majesty.

183
00:15:48,720-->00:15:51,640
This is her favorite rose hairpin.

184
00:16:05,159-->00:16:06,200
Are they beautiful on me?

185
00:16:07,119-->00:16:11,119
She did not even take the jade shoes I gifted her.

186
00:16:12,40-->00:16:14,880
She took few belongings with her.

187
00:16:21,160-->00:16:22,919
How did you get so ill?

188
00:16:23,639-->00:16:25,919
With tuberculosis, Mochou must not stay in Ganlu Temple.

189
00:16:26,0-->00:16:27,480
JINGBAI

190
00:16:27,560-->00:16:29,919
- Absolutely. - Enough.

191
00:16:30,440-->00:16:33,919
I know how you have been torturing her little by little.

192
00:16:34,720-->00:16:36,919
Is she truly unbearable?

193
00:16:37,520-->00:16:39,120
Mochou has been coughing for over half a month.

194
00:16:39,199-->00:16:41,279
She is so emaciated that her face reddens when she coughs.

195
00:16:41,360-->00:16:42,799
MOYAN

196
00:16:42,999-->00:16:45,999
It is probably incurable. We must not live with her.

197
00:16:46,80-->00:16:48,680
- Absolutely. - We must not live with her.

198
00:16:48,759-->00:16:50,240
Mochou,

199
00:16:50,320-->00:16:53,80
you are gravely ill now,

200
00:16:53,159-->00:16:56,720
and they are reluctant to be near you.

201
00:16:56,799-->00:16:59,399
It is best that you move out.

202
00:17:00,40-->00:17:05,359
Abbess, you do know I have nowhere to turn.

203
00:17:06,439-->00:17:08,479
Where could I go?

204
00:17:09,319-->00:17:13,359
Abbess, you fail to uphold justice, and merely listen to the nuns' nonsense.

205
00:17:13,440-->00:17:15,119
How gullible you are!

206
00:17:15,200-->00:17:16,240
Silence!

207
00:17:16,920-->00:17:18,599
How dare you fault the Abbess!

208
00:17:19,960-->00:17:23,479
You need not hit her. You are so domineering!

209
00:17:25,880-->00:17:29,359
Abbess, we do not know yet whether our lady has tuberculosis,

210
00:17:30,159-->00:17:34,440
but now she is very ill and weak, and it is bitterly cold outside,

211
00:17:34,519-->00:17:36,319
where can we go in the meantime?

212
00:17:36,400-->00:17:38,200
Please bear with us for a few more days.

213
00:17:38,960-->00:17:41,400
She is sickly. How can we live with her?

214
00:17:41,479-->00:17:43,880
If Mochou stays in Ganlu Temple, we will all leave.

215
00:17:43,960-->00:17:45,599
- You are right. - Yes.

216
00:17:46,440-->00:17:50,599
If Ganlu Temple cannot shelter us, we shall leave.

217
00:17:51,520-->00:17:54,239
There are some monastic dwellings at Mount Lingyun.

218
00:17:54,319-->00:17:56,880
You shall stay there and be exempted from your devotions.

219
00:17:56,960-->00:18:00,0
Remain there until you have recovered.

220
00:18:01,160-->00:18:03,320
Thank you, Abbess.

221
00:18:04,760-->00:18:06,359
No one desires to stay in such a place.

222
00:18:07,759-->00:18:10,359
I will help you pack up and escort you there.

223
00:18:24,160-->00:18:26,599
Mistress!

224
00:18:26,679-->00:18:30,40
- Madam! - What should we do now?

225
00:18:30,640-->00:18:33,200
It's impossible to reach Mount Lingyun in such heavy snow.

226
00:18:33,279-->00:18:34,839
We can't return to Ganlu Temple, either.

227
00:18:38,240-->00:18:40,400
There is still one place to go.

228
00:18:40,480-->00:18:43,39
Huanbi, his pavilion is not far.

229
00:18:43,119-->00:18:44,880
We must fetch him.

230
00:18:51,680-->00:18:53,440
Go quickly!

231
00:18:56,640-->00:18:59,959
Mistress! What should we do?

232
00:19:06,79-->00:19:08,240
Huanbi has been gone for quite some time.

233
00:19:08,839-->00:19:11,159
Will this individual you've sent for come or not?

234
00:19:11,240-->00:19:13,800
We must try our luck.

235
00:19:14,400-->00:19:17,239
If we truly have nowhere to go, and madam cannot be saved,

236
00:19:18,239-->00:19:20,359
we will stay with her until the end.

237
00:19:26,40-->00:19:27,440
My lord!

238
00:19:27,839-->00:19:30,760
My lord!

239
00:19:35,880-->00:19:38,359
- Have you sent for Doctor Wen? - Yes, sir.

240
00:19:38,440-->00:19:40,920
I insisted that Doctor Wen come to treat you, sir.

241
00:19:41,520-->00:19:44,79
But he has difficulty coming here because of the heavy snow.

242
00:19:44,160-->00:19:45,760
He must!

243
00:19:45,839-->00:19:49,160
We do not have much medicine here, and she has quite a fever.

244
00:19:49,240-->00:19:51,400
If it lasts much longer, it can be deadly.

245
00:19:52,0-->00:19:53,200
Quickly!

246
00:19:57,319-->00:19:59,680
Huanbi, you have been bustling around.

247
00:19:59,759-->00:20:01,359
You must rest, or you will exhaust yourself.

248
00:20:01,440-->00:20:03,920
- But mistress-- - We will take care of her.

249
00:20:03,999-->00:20:07,999
If you wear yourself out, how can you look after her?

250
00:20:09,880-->00:20:13,559
- Ah Jin, show Huanbi to her room. - Yes, sir.

251
00:20:14,79-->00:20:15,720
Huanbi, please come with me.

252
00:20:16,559-->00:20:18,279
Thank you for your help, my lord.

253
00:20:19,599-->00:20:21,0
Continue.

254
00:20:27,920-->00:20:30,839
I will attend to her. You may all leave.

255
00:20:30,920-->00:20:32,400
Yes, my lord.

256
00:20:56,79-->00:21:00,640
Dreams are vague the past, shrouded in mist

257
00:21:00,720-->00:21:04,599
In the beauty of autumn and spring

258
00:21:04,679-->00:21:09,119
I long for you endlessly to be eternally faithful

259
00:21:09,199-->00:21:13,960
But only the zither and the flute remain

260
00:21:14,559-->00:21:19,160
We are meant for each other

261
00:21:19,240-->00:21:23,79
Our souls remain together

262
00:21:23,160-->00:21:26,679
Forget me not, betray me not

263
00:21:26,760-->00:21:28,359
My lord, this is madness!

264
00:21:29,320-->00:21:33,279
I would gladly go mad if I could bring down her fever.

265
00:21:33,359-->00:21:35,719
Keep watch outside the room and say nothing of this.

266
00:21:36,319-->00:21:40,959
Fate has grieved us

267
00:21:41,40-->00:21:43,79
Our true love has after all

268
00:21:43,160-->00:21:50,160
Drifted away like fallen leaves

269
00:21:52,640-->00:21:57,240
I hope for the rising moon and the morning sun

270
00:21:57,319-->00:22:00,799
For the caress of the warm spring breeze

271
00:22:01,839-->00:22:06,359
Like a pair of phoenixes we shall wing our ways

272
00:22:06,439-->00:22:10,400
Far away without a trace

273
00:22:10,480-->00:22:15,519
Soft rain rustles the leaves of the wutong tree

274
00:22:15,599-->00:22:19,440
Memories blown away on the wind

275
00:22:20,319-->00:22:24,919
Soft rain rustles the leaves of the wutong tree

276
00:22:25,0-->00:22:29,920
Memories blown away on the wind

277
00:22:58,599-->00:23:00,119
Mistress, you have come to.

278
00:23:05,880-->00:23:08,839
Doctor Wen, come! She is awake.

279
00:23:14,239-->00:23:17,160
She is much better indeed.

280
00:23:17,239-->00:23:21,39
Then we should make haste to return.

281
00:23:22,440-->00:23:25,0
You have not fully recovered. Please rest to regain your strength.

282
00:23:25,720-->00:23:28,559
This is the ideal place to recuperate for we have few visitors here.

283
00:23:31,199-->00:23:34,560
His Lordship seems unwell.

284
00:23:35,160-->00:23:36,359
You must examine him.

285
00:23:36,439-->00:23:39,280
Please rest well while I examine His Lordship.

286
00:23:45,279-->00:23:47,280
His Lordship has always been in good health.

287
00:23:47,359-->00:23:49,519
A cold shall not matter.

288
00:23:49,599-->00:23:52,839
- He merely needs some rest. - Thank you, Doctor.

289
00:23:56,839-->00:23:59,840
Ah Jin, how is His Lordship?

290
00:23:59,920-->00:24:03,599
He has a violent cold. He has had nothing but medicine,

291
00:24:03,680-->00:24:05,280
and thus has lost much weight.

292
00:24:05,359-->00:24:07,520
How did he fall ill without reason?

293
00:24:11,599-->00:24:14,759
You may all leave. I shall have a word with Ah Jin.

294
00:24:14,840-->00:24:16,199
Yes, mistress.

295
00:24:21,0-->00:24:22,319
His Lordship is foolish,

296
00:24:22,400-->00:24:25,640
falling for someone he cannot have and acting rashly.

297
00:24:26,799-->00:24:30,359
Madam, you were feverish and cold towels were of no use.

298
00:24:30,440-->00:24:33,520
Then His Lordship decided to lie in the snow in solely his undershirt.

299
00:24:34,279-->00:24:37,279
After his body became stone-cold, he embraced you, madam.

300
00:24:37,359-->00:24:41,40
He did this several times until your fever finally dropped.

301
00:24:41,119-->00:24:44,640
Even a body strong as iron cannot bear this hardship.

302
00:24:45,679-->00:24:48,320
Still, please do not worry, madam.

303
00:24:48,400-->00:24:50,160
His Lordship never did anything inappropriate.

304
00:24:50,240-->00:24:52,440
You were neatly dressed.

305
00:24:53,479-->00:24:55,799
It is not the first time His Lordship has acted foolishly.

306
00:24:55,880-->00:24:58,400
Ever since he saved you at Yikun Palace,

307
00:24:58,480-->00:25:01,719
I have known that he is hopelessly in love.

308
00:25:03,320-->00:25:05,359
The snow has melted.

309
00:25:05,440-->00:25:07,559
We have troubled His Lordship for days.

310
00:25:07,640-->00:25:10,39
Tomorrow we will set out

311
00:25:10,640-->00:25:13,39
for the monastic dwelling at Mount Lingyun.

312
00:25:13,119-->00:25:15,720
I am thankful for His Lordship's hospitality.

313
00:25:30,560-->00:25:31,799
A cat!

314
00:25:32,759-->00:25:34,279
Jinxi, chase it out!

315
00:25:34,359-->00:25:36,920
The mistress is frightened of cats as she was injured by one before.

316
00:25:46,799-->00:25:47,839
Mistress!

317
00:25:50,319-->00:25:52,559
Don't be scared. I have chased out the cat.

318
00:25:54,160-->00:25:55,520
My lord.

319
00:25:56,240-->00:25:58,160
How could you keep birds?

320
00:25:58,239-->00:26:00,960
While there are no wild predators here, there are many feral cats.

321
00:26:01,39-->00:26:03,119
They live on birds.

322
00:26:03,200-->00:26:04,799
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

323
00:26:05,719-->00:26:07,640
It is Doctor Wen's fault.

324
00:26:07,720-->00:26:12,999
He brought the birds to amuse my lady, but only feral cats were attracted.

325
00:26:13,79-->00:26:15,159
Thank you, my lord, for saving us.

326
00:26:16,440-->00:26:18,320
Yet it is quite late at night.

327
00:26:18,400-->00:26:20,839
For what reason are you here?

328
00:26:21,439-->00:26:24,319
These days you could not sleep until the dead of night.

329
00:26:24,400-->00:26:26,640
No wonder you look pale.

330
00:26:26,720-->00:26:28,39
You have been here all the while.

331
00:26:28,119-->00:26:30,319
I merely intend to wait until you are asleep.

332
00:26:30,400-->00:26:34,519
I was asleep just now, yet still you remained nearby.

333
00:26:34,599-->00:26:36,439
I was simply enjoying the moonlight.

334
00:26:37,79-->00:26:41,559
I dozed off and was caught off-guard. I am sorry you were startled.

335
00:26:44,799-->00:26:48,680
Please return and sleep, my lord. It is quite late at night.

336
00:26:49,279-->00:26:51,759
Sleep at ease, my lady. I--

337
00:26:53,920-->00:26:55,799
I shall leave.

338
00:27:14,39-->00:27:16,280
His Lordship is playing the flute again.

339
00:27:17,680-->00:27:18,799
Is he?

340
00:27:18,880-->00:27:21,759
Only His Lordship's music can be of such emotion and richness.

341
00:27:23,119-->00:27:26,40
I wonder how long he will play tonight.

342
00:28:01,760-->00:28:05,199
Mistress, can you still hear the sound of the flute outside?

343
00:28:06,359-->00:28:07,759
Yes, I can.

344
00:28:10,880-->00:28:13,640
Poor soul, it's starting to rain.

345
00:28:14,799-->00:28:16,599
He may fall ill.

346
00:28:19,400-->00:28:23,680
Please leave the shadows behind you, madam.

347
00:28:24,319-->00:28:25,880
If you trouble your head over nothing,

348
00:28:25,959-->00:28:28,880
you only torture yourself and His Lordship.

349
00:28:30,400-->00:28:32,519
I have observed everything these past days.

350
00:28:33,400-->00:28:38,799
His love is profound and pure. You can glide through life at his side.

351
00:28:40,839-->00:28:42,999
Allow me to say,

352
00:28:43,79-->00:28:46,240
no one can foretell the future.

353
00:28:46,319-->00:28:50,800
It is best to follow your heart and pursue happiness in life.

354
00:28:50,880-->00:28:53,400
It is not worth securing the future

355
00:28:54,440-->00:28:56,359
at the expense of present wellness.

356
00:29:33,79-->00:29:36,0
Huan, is it you?

357
00:29:37,759-->00:29:39,160
Yes.

358
00:29:39,839-->00:29:41,40
Here I am.

359
00:29:58,400-->00:30:01,839
Su Peisheng, where are we?

360
00:30:02,319-->00:30:04,119
Your Majesty, this is Baijun Garden,

361
00:30:04,920-->00:30:08,240
designated training ground for fine horses offered in tribute.

362
00:30:08,319-->00:30:10,400
His Majesty the Emperor!

363
00:30:10,480-->00:30:12,480
May good fortune be with you, Your Majesty.

364
00:30:27,79-->00:30:28,800
Your Majesty--

365
00:30:45,159-->00:30:48,160
YE LANYI

366
00:30:55,920-->00:30:57,240
Eunuch Duan.

367
00:30:58,160-->00:30:59,840
Eunuch Su.

368
00:31:01,480-->00:31:03,640
Who is that lady on horseback?

369
00:31:03,720-->00:31:08,560
She is a horse trainer of Baijun Garden, named Ye Lanyi.

370
00:31:10,0-->00:31:11,880
A horse trainer.

371
00:31:15,960-->00:31:19,240
Young mistress, you have come to receive the imperial decree at last.

372
00:31:19,319-->00:31:20,919
Say what you must.

373
00:31:21,520-->00:31:22,559
It has been issued.

374
00:31:27,160-->00:31:30,519
Young mistress, you must kneel to receive the decree.

375
00:31:35,80-->00:31:37,759
"By the Grace of Heaven, the Emperor hereby decrees

376
00:31:37,839-->00:31:40,239
that Miss Ye of Yuanming Palace is bright and elegant.

377
00:31:40,320-->00:31:43,79
Ranked as Second Attendant, she shall move into the palace."

378
00:31:43,160-->00:31:44,799
Issued by His Imperial Majesty.

379
00:31:52,240-->00:31:54,400
Young mistress, you should show your gratitude.

380
00:31:56,479-->00:31:57,760
I thank His Majesty.

381
00:31:59,559-->00:32:02,840
Congratulations, young mistress. You are truly fortunate.

382
00:32:02,920-->00:32:06,519
Maidens of the Imperial Palace are usually ranked Female Attendant first.

383
00:32:06,599-->00:32:09,399
But you have bypassed that and become Second Attendant.

384
00:32:10,240-->00:32:11,280
Then accept this good fortune in my place.

385
00:32:11,359-->00:32:14,199
Young mistress, you cannot be serious.

386
00:32:15,760-->00:32:19,280
I can wait for him no longer, and I promised to show him my skills.

387
00:32:19,799-->00:32:21,599
Mistress, who is it that you mention?

388
00:32:21,680-->00:32:23,80
It is not your concern.

389
00:33:04,560-->00:33:07,999
Upheavals led by an official named Napodpa have taken place in Tibet.

390
00:33:09,920-->00:33:11,759
Now he's turning to the Dzungar Mongols.

391
00:33:12,920-->00:33:15,400
I've sent an Imperial Resident to Tibet,

392
00:33:16,279-->00:33:20,39
and I've been preparing to make war on the Dzungar Mongols,

393
00:33:21,0-->00:33:23,679
but many things remain unclear.

394
00:33:24,480-->00:33:26,759
You shall travel to Yunnan and Tibet to investigate.

395
00:33:26,839-->00:33:30,40
I appreciate your trust, Your Majesty, but I'm afraid I am incapable.

396
00:33:31,800-->00:33:36,400
You're barely involved in imperial affairs.

397
00:33:37,400-->00:33:38,599
If you travel incognito,

398
00:33:38,679-->00:33:42,119
it'll be easier to investigate, as no one recognizes you.

399
00:33:42,199-->00:33:46,200
You're the best person for this mission.

400
00:33:48,799-->00:33:50,39
I shall spare no effort.

401
00:33:53,440-->00:33:54,960
Are you leaving tomorrow?

402
00:33:55,39-->00:33:59,119
I must go for the sake of the country, Huan.

403
00:33:59,199-->00:34:02,759
Tarry not for the spring blossoms and return with haste,

404
00:34:03,599-->00:34:06,640
for I will be waiting here for you.

405
00:34:06,720-->00:34:08,359
For this reason,

406
00:34:09,840-->00:34:12,199
I will hurry back to you just as a flying arrow.

407
00:34:12,280-->00:34:13,800
I have everything arranged.

408
00:34:13,879-->00:34:16,359
Upon my return, I will take you away from this place.

409
00:34:16,440-->00:34:17,599
Is that true?

410
00:34:22,559-->00:34:26,800
I bow before Your Highness, and all the young mistresses.

411
00:34:26,880-->00:34:28,239
You may rise.

412
00:34:30,800-->00:34:33,760
You have been here for some time, but I have yet to meet you.

413
00:34:33,840-->00:34:37,639
I had to invite you over to gather with the other concubines.

414
00:34:38,520-->00:34:41,320
His Majesty knows well my cold character and my distaste for social activities,

415
00:34:41,400-->00:34:43,280
so I am exempt from the formal salutation.

416
00:34:44,239-->00:34:45,920
His Majesty is surely generous,

417
00:34:45,999-->00:34:48,79
but how could you fail to pay respect to Her Highness,

418
00:34:48,160-->00:34:49,760
who leads the Imperial Harem?

419
00:34:50,760-->00:34:54,440
If I respect her with all my heart, daily greeting may not be necessary.

420
00:34:55,560-->00:35:00,119
Besides, any one of the ladies here could be playing a double game.

421
00:35:00,199-->00:35:01,800
You--

422
00:35:01,880-->00:35:04,479
Your Highness, what insolence!

423
00:35:05,559-->00:35:07,880
Your Highness, if you have no other commands,

424
00:35:07,959-->00:35:09,800
I shall consider my duty fulfilled.

425
00:35:09,880-->00:35:11,239
I will excuse myself now.

426
00:35:15,159-->00:35:18,320
Your Highness, you see, she--

427
00:35:18,399-->00:35:21,719
She has done nothing wrong. Why do you take offense?

428
00:35:22,360-->00:35:26,39
Concubine Huan was arrogant, having won His Majesty's favor.

429
00:35:26,760-->00:35:29,159
That I can comprehend.

430
00:35:29,239-->00:35:31,840
But Second Attendant Ye was a low-ranking servant before.

431
00:35:31,920-->00:35:35,119
How dare she speak in such a manner to Your Highness!

432
00:35:35,199-->00:35:38,959
Having won His Majesty's favor, she will bear a prince soon enough.

433
00:35:40,39-->00:35:42,199
Concubine Qi was right.

434
00:35:42,280-->00:35:46,800
If only she were barren.

435
00:35:47,920-->00:35:51,79
Consider what I have told you.

436
00:35:51,159-->00:35:53,159
It is not for my benefit,

437
00:35:53,239-->00:35:56,800
but for the sake of an untroubled future for the Third Prince.

438
00:36:00,40-->00:36:02,39
Madam, what is the matter?

439
00:36:02,120-->00:36:04,119
Was it something you ate?

440
00:36:09,599-->00:36:10,999
Could it be--

441
00:36:12,879-->00:36:15,0
Congratulations, madam!

442
00:36:15,80-->00:36:18,320
It has not yet been a month. Lower your voice.

443
00:36:22,239-->00:36:23,239
Huanbi.

444
00:36:28,919-->00:36:31,199
My child will be yours, too.

445
00:36:31,959-->00:36:36,919
We will raise the child together, won't we?

446
00:36:38,239-->00:36:39,719
Is it true?

447
00:36:44,239-->00:36:46,440
The child of the mistress and His Lordship

448
00:36:47,480-->00:36:49,479
will be mine as well.

449
00:36:51,79-->00:36:52,599
I bow before Second Attendant Ye.

450
00:36:52,680-->00:36:56,400
Consort Qi sends you some red-date soup.

451
00:37:05,79-->00:37:06,320
Must I drink it?

452
00:37:06,400-->00:37:08,480
It is an act of kindness from Consort Qi.

453
00:37:31,800-->00:37:34,560
Why does Second Attendant Ye suffer from ceaseless stomach pain?

454
00:37:35,719-->00:37:37,239
Your Majesty,

455
00:37:37,319-->00:37:41,839
Second Attendant Ye had some food of an extremely cold nature

456
00:37:43,119-->00:37:45,400
and her body has been damaged.

457
00:37:45,480-->00:37:49,320
She may never be able to conceive a child.

458
00:37:50,280-->00:37:52,800
Who did this? Speak!

459
00:37:53,880-->00:37:56,159
What did she have before the stomach pain started?

460
00:37:56,239-->00:37:58,800
Consort Qi asked Cuiguo to bring her a red-date soup.

461
00:37:58,879-->00:38:01,239
The young mistress fell ill after drinking it.

462
00:38:01,320-->00:38:02,999
Consort Qi?

463
00:38:04,119-->00:38:06,440
Is it true that you did this?

464
00:38:07,239-->00:38:10,199
Your Highness, I merely acted on your words.

465
00:38:10,280-->00:38:12,360
My words?

466
00:38:12,439-->00:38:15,719
Have I ever instructed you to harm others?

467
00:38:16,400-->00:38:18,840
You are the one who planned all of this.

468
00:38:19,560-->00:38:22,999
Merely out of benevolence, I might try to help you.

469
00:38:23,80-->00:38:26,199
But if you cannot be saved, you have solely yourself to blame.

470
00:38:26,800-->00:38:30,679
You are too malicious to help the Third Prince succeed to the throne.

471
00:38:31,559-->00:38:35,79
With such a ruthless mother, he will never become the Crown Prince.

472
00:38:36,479-->00:38:38,599
You must put an end to this.

473
00:38:39,199-->00:38:42,439
In your stead, I shall help the Third Prince succeed to the throne.

474
00:38:43,320-->00:38:46,400
You may choose your own course.

475
00:39:20,239-->00:39:25,560
Consort Qi, why on earth did you end your life?

476
00:39:27,960-->00:39:31,120
Your Majesty, Consort Qi's memorial--

477
00:39:31,199-->00:39:35,199
She did it to escape punishment, thus she is not fit for a posthumous name.

478
00:39:36,40-->00:39:39,559
To keep this behind closed doors, and for the sake of the Third Prince,

479
00:39:40,320-->00:39:42,600
she shall not be held to account.

480
00:39:44,719-->00:39:46,440
Consort Qi is dead.

481
00:39:47,39-->00:39:51,519
Although the Third Prince has grown up, he must be looked after.

482
00:39:52,680-->00:39:55,160
I lead the Imperial Harem,

483
00:39:55,239-->00:39:59,760
and I have treated all children here as my own.

484
00:40:00,400-->00:40:04,479
Moreover, I have been raising the Third Prince.

485
00:40:05,199-->00:40:08,400
I shall devote myself to my maternal duties with all my heart.

486
00:40:08,480-->00:40:11,360
It relieves me to hear these words.

487
00:40:12,280-->00:40:15,319
It is most proper to entrust him to your care.

488
00:40:16,760-->00:40:18,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:40:24,80-->00:40:25,480
I know you are grieved,

490
00:40:26,199-->00:40:29,40
but the imperial doctors are knowledgeable.

491
00:40:29,119-->00:40:31,440
You may yet bear a child of your own.

492
00:40:31,520-->00:40:34,879
Why should I grieve?

493
00:40:35,840-->00:40:38,599
You've come to see me since I was tricked,

494
00:40:38,679-->00:40:41,560
the same as your best friend, Concubine Huan.

495
00:40:43,199-->00:40:46,920
Similar, yet different.

496
00:40:48,679-->00:40:50,879
It does not matter,

497
00:40:50,960-->00:40:53,480
it is merely one life after all.

498
00:40:54,440-->00:40:59,79
Very well. Then rest. You shall not be disturbed.

499
00:41:01,80-->00:41:02,840
With or without Consort Qi's red-date soup,

500
00:41:02,920-->00:41:05,159
I have no desire to have children.

501
00:41:06,880-->00:41:08,679
I merely felt suspicious

502
00:41:09,320-->00:41:12,400
as the red-date soup seemed so strange.

503
00:41:12,479-->00:41:14,959
Even my cat could smell that something was wrong.

504
00:41:15,920-->00:41:19,800
She had every intention of killing me, so I let her fulfill her wish.

505
00:41:20,519-->00:41:22,480
Do you truly desire to die?

506
00:41:22,559-->00:41:25,719
I was alone, free as a bird,

507
00:41:26,439-->00:41:28,679
but now I am locked up here until my dying day,

508
00:41:29,480-->00:41:32,399
at the service of a man that I have no interest in.

509
00:41:33,119-->00:41:37,639
- He has deprived me of my one chance. - What chance?

510
00:41:40,360-->00:41:42,159
It is now of little import.

511
00:41:43,320-->00:41:46,239
Consort Qi has helped me settle the matter.

512
00:41:46,320-->00:41:48,520
I do not wish to bear his child at all.

513
00:41:52,280-->00:41:55,399
Never speak such nonsense again.

514
00:41:57,239-->00:42:01,80
May good fortune be with you, Concubine Hui and Second Attendant Ye.

515
00:42:02,840-->00:42:04,839
An imperial decree has been issued.

516
00:42:08,280-->00:42:10,719
"Second Attendant Ye has been wronged

517
00:42:11,479-->00:42:13,400
and we lament her loss.

518
00:42:13,479-->00:42:18,399
Second Attendant Ye shall be granted the rank of Noble Lady, called Ning."

519
00:42:18,479-->00:42:20,360
Issued by His Imperial Majesty.

520
00:42:21,199-->00:42:22,800
I thank His Majesty.

521
00:42:26,639-->00:42:28,719
Doctor Wen, please follow me.

522
00:42:28,800-->00:42:31,199
- Madam. - Here you are.

523
00:42:31,959-->00:42:35,559
Please take this new medicine for pregnancy, my lady.

524
00:42:36,360-->00:42:40,399
Have you not rested well? You look very pale.

525
00:42:41,39-->00:42:43,599
His Lordship said he would return in 40 days,

526
00:42:43,679-->00:42:46,800
but he has been gone 50 days and we have not received word of him.

527
00:42:46,880-->00:42:48,479
Madam is certainly worried.

528
00:42:48,560-->00:42:51,119
Last night she had a nightmare and could not sleep well.

529
00:42:51,199-->00:42:53,119
Therefore, she is ashen-faced.

530
00:42:53,679-->00:42:55,760
We must not take heed of nightmares.

531
00:42:56,719-->00:42:59,0
He shall return soon.

532
00:43:01,320-->00:43:03,280
He will not.

533
00:43:05,79-->00:43:06,880
What did you say?

534
00:43:06,959-->00:43:10,160
Marquess Guo will never return. He is dead.

535
00:43:11,520-->00:43:13,919
Doctor Wen, you--

536
00:43:17,280-->00:43:19,159
What nonsense is this?

537
00:43:20,199-->00:43:23,400
How could you jinx him, the father of my child?

538
00:43:25,199-->00:43:28,400
Have I ever in my life deceived you, Huan?

539
00:43:29,239-->00:43:31,840
Marquess Guo did not return from his journey to Yunnan and Tibet,

540
00:43:31,920-->00:43:34,400
and we received no news of him.

541
00:43:34,479-->00:43:36,640
His Majesty sent men to look for him,

542
00:43:36,719-->00:43:39,800
but it is said that the vessel he took sank,

543
00:43:39,880-->00:43:42,39
and his body has not yet been found.

544
00:43:43,40-->00:43:44,400
Madam!

545
00:43:44,480-->00:43:47,439
Huan, the current of the Yellow River was so swift

546
00:43:47,520-->00:43:49,320
that even an iron vessel was shattered.

547
00:43:50,0-->00:43:52,840
Even if his body were found, he would not be recognizable.

548
00:43:57,719-->00:43:59,360
He is dead.

549
00:44:04,920-->00:44:07,440
I was not fated to see him one last time.

550
00:44:08,239-->00:44:09,520
Huan.

551
00:44:10,719-->00:44:13,719
Huan, come to your senses. The dead will never return to life.

552
00:44:15,599-->00:44:18,79
The dead will never return to life.

553
00:44:19,79-->00:44:21,800
His soul has never entered my dreams.

554
00:44:22,440-->00:44:24,960
- Huan! - Madam!

555
00:44:25,39-->00:44:26,280
Huan!

556
00:44:27,79-->00:44:28,280
Huan.

557
00:44:29,919-->00:44:31,559
Impossible.

558
00:44:34,679-->00:44:36,320
It is impossible.

559
00:44:38,359-->00:44:39,639
It cannot be.

560
00:44:45,959-->00:44:50,679
Madam, if you refuse to eat, please at least take this medicine.

561
00:44:50,760-->00:44:55,799
I requested Doctor Wen to prescribe this medicine for you.

562
00:44:57,679-->00:44:59,919
It is very effective.

563
00:45:00,639-->00:45:04,119
The unborn child will certainly die.

564
00:45:04,200-->00:45:05,640
Please take it, madam.

565
00:45:11,800-->00:45:13,320
You must not take it, mistress!

566
00:45:13,400-->00:45:16,800
You must keep this baby, the sole kin of His Lordship.

567
00:45:19,600-->00:45:21,159
The child must not be aborted.

568
00:45:23,920-->00:45:25,280
Jinxi,

569
00:45:28,40-->00:45:32,480
I will not take the medicine that causes miscarriage.

570
00:45:35,360-->00:45:37,0
I want this baby.

571
00:45:39,679-->00:45:41,79
Yunli is dead.

572
00:45:43,119-->00:45:46,359
No one else will protect me as he has.

573
00:45:48,160-->00:45:50,479
I must learn to protect myself

574
00:45:51,640-->00:45:54,159
and those I care for.

575
00:45:54,920-->00:45:58,199
Madam, the old Zhen Huan that I knew has returned.

576
00:46:02,239-->00:46:04,39
I must not die.

577
00:46:05,760-->00:46:07,360
For the sake of my unborn child

578
00:46:08,159-->00:46:10,480
and of Yunli who has died for nothing,

579
00:46:12,600-->00:46:14,199
I must live,

580
00:46:15,280-->00:46:17,320
and live well.

581
00:46:17,399-->00:46:19,200
What do you intend to do, madam?

582
00:46:19,280-->00:46:21,79
Royal status

583
00:46:22,680-->00:46:24,480
must be acquired for this child.

584
00:46:27,360-->00:46:29,400
Yunli once told me

585
00:46:31,320-->00:46:36,119
that His Majesty uttered my name in his sleep.

586
00:46:36,199-->00:46:37,999
I am not absolutely certain of success,

587
00:46:39,199-->00:46:40,960
but I must do all I can.

588
00:46:47,320-->00:46:49,320
We shall return to the palace.

589
00:46:55,760-->00:46:57,119
Jinxi?

590
00:46:58,479-->00:46:59,840
You have come.

591
00:47:00,679-->00:47:02,800
- You there! - Yes, sir.

592
00:47:02,880-->00:47:05,479
Replace the tea leaves with those given by His Majesty.

593
00:47:07,0-->00:47:09,39
Please drink mine.

594
00:47:12,479-->00:47:13,599
Thank you, Eunuch Su.

595
00:47:13,679-->00:47:18,119
No need to be so courteous. Call me by my name.

596
00:47:18,199-->00:47:19,200
Peisheng.

597
00:47:20,320-->00:47:22,199
Please sit.

598
00:47:22,840-->00:47:26,839
The residence has been refurbished. Is it comfortable?

599
00:47:26,920-->00:47:31,760
Well enough, but it seems empty, as I live here alone.

600
00:47:32,639-->00:47:35,79
After all these years, I am already well used to it.

601
00:47:36,640-->00:47:38,40
Then,

602
00:47:39,39-->00:47:40,880
it is too late for me

603
00:47:42,320-->00:47:44,79
to accompany you.

604
00:47:50,600-->00:47:52,40
What happened?

605
00:47:52,639-->00:47:54,880
At last you consent to live with me.

606
00:47:58,960-->00:48:02,560
Your legs must ache after a long day's work.

607
00:48:04,600-->00:48:08,880
Life is full of twists and turns indeed.

608
00:48:09,480-->00:48:13,679
Some people are meant to be together.

609
00:48:15,920-->00:48:18,760
But I pity Concubine Huan.

610
00:48:19,320-->00:48:22,319
There will be no one left to take care of her.

611
00:48:23,959-->00:48:25,439
I pity her in earnest.

612
00:48:27,760-->00:48:31,239
Are you suggesting that Concubine Wan and His Majesty--

613
00:48:31,959-->00:48:34,159
Can you be sure of helping them?

614
00:48:35,360-->00:48:39,480
If the love between Concubine Wan and His Majesty is revived,

615
00:48:40,880-->00:48:45,159
we may be together as a matter of course.

616
00:48:55,840-->00:48:57,600
- I greet Your Majesty. - You may rise.

617
00:48:57,679-->00:49:00,920
- I thank Your Majesty. - I've just visited the Queen Mother.

618
00:49:01,639-->00:49:03,920
She still looks quite pale.

619
00:49:04,0-->00:49:06,119
I was told that you have been looking after her.

620
00:49:06,199-->00:49:08,320
It is my filial duty.

621
00:49:10,280-->00:49:11,719
You may rise.

622
00:49:13,0-->00:49:15,40
Your Majesty, what a fine day.

623
00:49:15,119-->00:49:18,639
Even Concubine Hui and the princess came out to enjoy the spring weather.

624
00:49:19,320-->00:49:20,559
Indeed.

625
00:49:21,159-->00:49:24,599
In a few days, it will be the Spring Dragon Festival.

626
00:49:25,480-->00:49:30,159
Traditionally, you make an excursion and pray for good fortune.

627
00:49:30,239-->00:49:33,800
Will you be praying for good fortune at Baohua Temple, Your Majesty?

628
00:49:33,880-->00:49:38,119
I shall spare myself the trouble and read memoranda in Yangxin Hall.

629
00:49:38,199-->00:49:42,0
The Spring Dragon Festival is of great significance, Your Majesty.

630
00:49:42,79-->00:49:44,440
It is said, "when the dragon raises its head,

631
00:49:44,519-->00:49:46,400
abundant harvests of crops are promised ahead."

632
00:49:46,480-->00:49:49,800
It is the moment to pray for a year of prosperity and peace.

633
00:49:50,400-->00:49:53,440
If you make an excursion

634
00:49:53,520-->00:49:56,360
and pray for good fortune on the same day,

635
00:49:56,439-->00:49:58,479
I can think of the perfect place.

636
00:49:58,559-->00:50:02,120
As I child, I remember taking a spring walk at Mount Lingyun,

637
00:50:02,199-->00:50:03,800
where stunning views may be seen.

638
00:50:03,880-->00:50:06,599
Then we may pray for good fortune at Ganlu Temple,

639
00:50:06,679-->00:50:08,480
perfect for spending the day.

640
00:50:08,559-->00:50:12,840
Concubine Hui is quite knowledgeable. That is the place I wished to mention.

641
00:50:12,920-->00:50:15,880
Now is the time to enjoy the beautiful scenery at Ganlu Temple,

642
00:50:15,959-->00:50:18,639
pleasant for a tranquil stroll.

643
00:50:18,719-->00:50:22,760
Besides, no idlers will be near as it belongs to the Imperial Palace.

644
00:50:22,840-->00:50:24,599
Ganlu Temple.

645
00:50:28,559-->00:50:31,80
Your Majesty, please have some tea.

646
00:50:37,199-->00:50:40,280
Where is Concubine Wan?

647
00:50:40,360-->00:50:41,639
Your Majesty,

648
00:50:41,719-->00:50:46,760
she fell ill and moved to a monastic dwelling at Mount Lingyun.

649
00:50:47,840-->00:50:49,439
She was ill?

650
00:50:49,519-->00:50:52,0
For how long? Was it serious?

651
00:50:52,599-->00:50:56,639
Concubine Wan should have recovered by now.

652
00:50:56,719-->00:50:58,159
Nonsense!

653
00:50:58,760-->00:51:00,679
What are you suggesting?

654
00:51:00,760-->00:51:03,160
How could the Abbess not know?

655
00:51:03,239-->00:51:05,39
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

656
00:51:05,119-->00:51:09,520
It has been a great honor to have Concubine Wan study Buddhism with us.

657
00:51:09,599-->00:51:10,599
Yes, sir.

658
00:51:10,679-->00:51:13,320
She has great compassion,

659
00:51:13,400-->00:51:15,400
offering to wash clothes, chop firewood

660
00:51:15,480-->00:51:17,960
and shoulder buckets of water for the old and weak at the temple.

661
00:51:19,839-->00:51:23,719
Did she truly perform all of those tasks?

662
00:51:23,800-->00:51:25,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

663
00:52:20,760-->00:52:23,999
Madam, you didn't sleep well yet again. You had better--

664
00:52:24,999-->00:52:26,600
Your Majesty!

665
00:52:26,679-->00:52:28,79
"Your Majesty"?

666
00:52:29,760-->00:52:31,800
How could His Majesty come here?

667
00:52:32,639-->00:52:35,519
Madam, it truly is His Majesty. I deceive you not.

668
00:52:45,559-->00:52:46,559
Huan Huan.

669
00:52:48,960-->00:52:53,800
The nuns of Ganlu Temple say you moved here because of your illness

670
00:52:53,880-->00:52:55,639
and have recovered already.

671
00:52:55,719-->00:52:58,519
But you seem to me quite sickly.

672
00:52:58,599-->00:53:00,480
Your Majesty,

673
00:53:00,559-->00:53:03,360
during the month of convalescence after giving birth,

674
00:53:03,439-->00:53:06,760
her body was not well cared for, causing her ill health.

675
00:53:07,639-->00:53:12,400
At first we were told she would recover by spring.

676
00:53:12,479-->00:53:16,440
Yet since her departure, she has longed for Your Majesty and the princess.

677
00:53:17,239-->00:53:19,879
She often falls into a trance, unable to sleep for nights on end.

678
00:53:19,960-->00:53:22,559
For this reason she has never recovered fully.

679
00:54:19,839-->00:54:21,800
Madam, Eunuch Su has come.

680
00:54:24,239-->00:54:25,920
I bow before the Consort.

681
00:54:25,999-->00:54:28,800
- No need to be so formal. Please sit. - Thank you, my lady.

682
00:54:28,879-->00:54:30,480
Huanbi, serve tea.

683
00:54:33,399-->00:54:36,400
It is no fine tea, but it has quite a delicate fragrance.

684
00:54:36,479-->00:54:38,80
Thank you, my lady.

685
00:54:38,679-->00:54:41,159
My lady, what is the matter?

686
00:54:41,239-->00:54:44,40
She has felt sick for some days.

687
00:54:48,880-->00:54:53,80
Congratulations, my lady!

688
00:54:53,679-->00:54:57,479
You are the first to know after Jinxi and Huanbi.

689
00:54:57,560-->00:54:58,879
I see.

690
00:54:58,960-->00:55:01,559
Please forgive my curiosity.

691
00:55:02,239-->00:55:05,79
How long has it been, my lady?

692
00:55:05,960-->00:55:09,599
Barely over a month.

693
00:55:11,239-->00:55:15,920
Wasn't that exactly when His Majesty first came to Mount Lingyun?

694
00:55:15,999-->00:55:19,320
I must congratulate you again, my lady.

695
00:55:19,400-->00:55:22,199
This conception comes at the best moment.

696
00:55:22,280-->00:55:26,360
It will now be appropriate for you to return to the palace.

697
00:55:27,79-->00:55:30,239
A rejected concubine cannot return to the palace.

698
00:55:31,559-->00:55:37,80
I merely wish for this child to grow up safe and well.

699
00:55:37,159-->00:55:40,399
Why do you say this, my lady?

700
00:55:40,999-->00:55:43,0
Your child is of royal blood.

701
00:55:43,79-->00:55:45,760
His name must be put in the genealogy of the royal family.

702
00:55:45,840-->00:55:48,119
Besides, His Majesty thinks much of his descendants.

703
00:55:48,199-->00:55:50,280
He will cherish the child.

704
00:55:51,320-->00:55:54,800
Should His Majesty grant my unborn child royal status,

705
00:55:55,760-->00:55:59,880
I would be most grateful, even were I to return as Second Attendant.

706
00:56:01,239-->00:56:03,479
My lady and the royal child are of utmost importance.

707
00:56:03,560-->00:56:06,400
I will tell His Majesty.

708
00:56:06,479-->00:56:10,560
You must make haste, and tell no one of this.

709
00:56:10,639-->00:56:12,639
Madam remains outside the palace.

710
00:56:12,719-->00:56:17,439
If it is known that she carries a child, who knows what chaos would ensue.

711
00:56:17,520-->00:56:21,40
I understand the importance. Take good care of your mistress.

712
00:56:21,119-->00:56:23,959
As soon as I return, I shall tell His Majesty

713
00:56:24,39-->00:56:26,400
that Doctor Wen must attend to the pregnancy of Her Highness.

714
00:56:26,479-->00:56:31,400
- Is it true that Zhen Huan is pregnant? - Absolutely.

715
00:56:31,480-->00:56:34,920
Doctor Wen prepared pregnancy medicine at the Imperial Medical Bureau.

716
00:56:35,0-->00:56:37,280
But no young mistress here is pregnant.

717
00:56:37,360-->00:56:41,960
The only one Doctor Wen would care for resides at Mount Lingyun.

718
00:56:42,39-->00:56:45,959
No matter how hard we tried, we have failed to prevent this from happening.

719
00:56:46,39-->00:56:47,760
It would be easier if she did not carry a child.

720
00:56:47,840-->00:56:51,440
Now it is another matter.

721
00:56:54,520-->00:56:59,320
Everything is well arranged at the palace. Soon my lady can return.

722
00:57:00,40-->00:57:02,639
His Majesty will grant you the title of Consort Xi.

723
00:57:02,719-->00:57:04,39
You shall live at Yongshou Palace.

724
00:57:04,119-->00:57:06,599
He also requested that you raise the Fourth Prince.

725
00:57:07,360-->00:57:09,559
- The Fourth Prince? - Yes, my lady.

726
00:57:09,639-->00:57:14,239
You were rejected, my lady. There is a great stir about your return.

727
00:57:14,919-->00:57:19,200
To avoid suspicion, His Majesty grants you the noble surname Niohuru,

728
00:57:19,280-->00:57:21,880
and states that you are the birth mother of the Fourth Prince.

729
00:57:21,959-->00:57:26,280
Ten years have been added to your age. You are now 32, my lady.

730
00:57:26,360-->00:57:30,239
Truly? How could madam seem 32?

731
00:57:30,920-->00:57:32,719
Of course not.

732
00:57:32,800-->00:57:37,400
It is to prevent further rumors.

733
00:57:38,40-->00:57:39,639
It is unimportant.

734
00:57:39,719-->00:57:42,439
It is good that His Majesty has arranged it so.

735
00:57:44,239-->00:57:49,600
Queen Mother, I wish to bring Zhen Huan back to the palace soon.

736
00:57:49,679-->00:57:52,440
I merely need to appoint a Conferring Emissary.

737
00:57:53,119-->00:57:56,600
She should now be three months along.

738
00:57:56,679-->00:57:59,719
It is time for her to be looked after in the palace.

739
00:58:00,760-->00:58:04,79
Your Majesty, he has returned!

740
00:58:04,159-->00:58:07,480
Calm yourself and speak clearly.

741
00:58:08,119-->00:58:09,639
Who has returned?

742
00:58:09,719-->00:58:10,760
Huan!

743
00:58:15,639-->00:58:16,639
Huan!

744
00:58:23,559-->00:58:24,999
My lord!

745
00:58:33,599-->00:58:36,679
Huan, have you waited for me?

746
00:58:43,800-->00:58:47,560
This is a joyous day for my lady.

747
00:58:47,639-->00:58:50,400
Clothing moist with tears is an ill omen.

748
00:58:50,479-->00:58:52,719
Go change into something more festive.

749
00:58:53,320-->00:58:56,920
His Lordship has returned safe and sound. I must burn incense to thank the Buddha.

750
00:59:02,719-->00:59:05,760
The imperial edict has been issued. It is irreversible.

751
00:59:05,840-->00:59:08,119
If you are swayed by emotion,

752
00:59:08,199-->00:59:11,479
endless troubles await us in the future.

753
00:59:16,840-->00:59:18,79
"My lady"?

754
00:59:21,239-->00:59:23,280
I did not expect...

755
00:59:26,639-->00:59:29,320
to see you return alive and well in this lifetime, my lord.

756
00:59:29,919-->00:59:30,959
"My lord"?

757
00:59:32,280-->00:59:37,0
We were parted for merely four months, but all has changed swiftly.

758
00:59:37,999-->00:59:39,239
You are called "my lady" again.

759
00:59:42,439-->00:59:47,39
I have not heard these titles for so long. They sound strange to me.

760
00:59:48,800-->00:59:50,519
I am glad you have returned.

761
00:59:51,519-->00:59:54,999
I wish I had died out there and never returned!

762
00:59:57,600-->00:59:58,960
Huan,

763
01:0:0,559-->01:0:2,679
if it were not for you, I would not have survived!

764
01:0:5,159-->01:0:6,559
But I have returned

765
01:0:7,719-->01:0:12,679
only to find that you are to return to the palace, into His Majesty's embrace.

766
01:0:12,760-->01:0:14,559
If you had not returned,

767
01:0:15,319-->01:0:17,399
you would have thought I was waiting for you.

768
01:0:18,599-->01:0:20,199
If you had not returned,

769
01:0:21,0-->01:0:23,679
you would not have known I am such a heartless soul!

770
01:0:26,159-->01:0:29,0
Heartless?

771
01:0:35,719-->01:0:37,119
Heartless!

772
01:0:40,760-->01:0:44,400
I have done you wrong, my lord. It will do no good to say more.

773
01:0:44,480-->01:0:46,520
Please leave, my lord.

774
01:0:51,959-->01:0:53,199
I am glad you have returned.

775
01:0:54,39-->01:0:57,519
God has indeed blessed our empire.

776
01:0:59,119-->01:1:3,479
I could not have survived without your blessing, Your Majesty.

777
01:1:3,560-->01:1:5,440
You have returned at the right moment.

778
01:1:6,559-->01:1:10,39
I was not sure who to appoint for a happy occasion.

779
01:1:10,120-->01:1:11,159
I am at your command.

780
01:1:12,600-->01:1:15,119
I desire to bring Consort Xi back to the palace,

781
01:1:16,679-->01:1:19,280
who was known as Concubine Wan.

782
01:1:21,519-->01:1:24,399
She was once rejected but will now return to the palace.

783
01:1:25,399-->01:1:27,560
It has given rise to a flurry of discussion.

784
01:1:28,159-->01:1:31,359
I intend to appoint a respectable person of high position as Conferring Emissary

785
01:1:31,440-->01:1:33,840
to escort Consort Xi back to the palace.

786
01:1:33,920-->01:1:37,360
Yet other, older imperial brothers have declined,

787
01:1:37,440-->01:1:39,480
so you are the sole one I can rely on.

788
01:1:40,280-->01:1:43,479
If I am to be the emissary, will it bring more honor to Consort Xi?

789
01:1:44,559-->01:1:48,160
Were it not so, I would not appoint you.

790
01:1:51,320-->01:1:53,80
I understand.

791
01:2:1,959-->01:2:6,40
Seeing you here safe, I may now return to the palace without worries.

792
01:2:9,559-->01:2:10,999
You came merely to say this?

793
01:2:12,479-->01:2:14,599
What did you expect, my lord?

794
01:2:14,680-->01:2:17,880
We were parted for so many days yet you do not even ask what befell me.

795
01:2:17,960-->01:2:19,600
Does it matter?

796
01:2:22,559-->01:2:26,920
That day my vessel sank in the Yellow River,

797
01:2:27,0-->01:2:28,599
everything was washed away!

798
01:2:29,360-->01:2:32,639
Were I not an accomplished swimmer, my body would remain submerged even now.

799
01:2:33,840-->01:2:35,440
I reached the shore with great difficulty,

800
01:2:36,519-->01:2:38,840
but was ambushed by Dzungar spies.

801
01:2:38,920-->01:2:40,880
I was being taken from Longnan to Dzungaria,

802
01:2:40,960-->01:2:43,320
but I took my chances and seized one of the horses.

803
01:2:43,400-->01:2:46,800
I knew you would be worried, so I traveled day and night to see you.

804
01:2:46,880-->01:2:48,679
You came too late!

805
01:2:50,239-->01:2:51,519
Yunli,

806
01:2:52,599-->01:2:54,199
love is not the only treasure

807
01:2:55,199-->01:2:56,800
in the entire world.

808
01:2:58,280-->01:3:0,280
The imperial edict has been issued.

809
01:3:0,959-->01:3:5,199
If we fail to execute it, every person near to us will be punished.

810
01:3:5,919-->01:3:9,359
We cannot be so selfish as to sacrifice them for our happiness.

811
01:3:9,440-->01:3:11,960
You cannot do it, nor can I.

812
01:3:13,800-->01:3:15,599
In this vast world,

813
01:3:15,679-->01:3:18,880
there is no place for you and me.

814
01:3:20,960-->01:3:22,999
We have no choice.

815
01:3:29,919-->01:3:32,520
Consort Xi returns!

816
01:3:52,519-->01:3:55,520
"By the Grace of Heaven, the Emperor decrees

817
01:3:56,239-->01:3:58,280
that the liveliness of the Imperial Palace endures

818
01:3:58,360-->01:3:59,880
by virtue of the good and the beautiful.

819
01:3:59,959-->01:4:1,999
Niohuru Zhen Huan,

820
01:4:2,79-->01:4:5,199
a well-born lady of benevolence and many virtues,

821
01:4:5,280-->01:4:7,159
is now conferred as Consort Xi

822
01:4:7,239-->01:4:9,239
in accord with the Empress Dowager's order."

823
01:4:9,840-->01:4:12,320
Issued by His Imperial Majesty.

824
01:4:17,600-->01:4:18,880
It is now four months?

825
01:4:20,79-->01:4:21,320
Yes, Your Highness.

826
01:4:23,439-->01:4:25,679
The Emperor is growing old,

827
01:4:25,759-->01:4:28,919
but he has fewer men of true loyalty near to him.

828
01:4:30,360-->01:4:32,919
Since you have returned,

829
01:4:32,999-->01:4:35,480
you shall counsel him.

830
01:4:36,159-->01:4:38,959
He will certainly listen to you.

831
01:4:39,39-->01:4:40,880
I shall abide by your words, Your Highness.

832
01:4:40,959-->01:4:42,640
Very well.

833
01:4:44,960-->01:4:49,760
You are like a sister to Consort Xi. She will have her second child.

834
01:4:49,840-->01:4:51,840
You should hasten to have your own.

835
01:4:53,639-->01:4:55,759
I thought highly of you,

836
01:4:55,840-->01:4:59,320
but you do not devote yourself to the Emperor.

837
01:5:27,0-->01:5:30,999
I used to think you calm and graceful,

838
01:5:32,40-->01:5:34,40
but after all that has transpired,

839
01:5:34,639-->01:5:37,79
at last I realize you are proud.

840
01:5:39,79-->01:5:40,679
I understand

841
01:5:41,319-->01:5:44,440
that all these years you have resented me.

842
01:5:47,559-->01:5:49,240
I dare not, Your Majesty.

843
01:5:51,199-->01:5:52,840
You are not speaking your mind.

844
01:5:53,959-->01:5:55,800
Be honest with me.

845
01:5:56,800-->01:5:58,800
Since the departure of Consort Xi,

846
01:5:59,479-->01:6:2,40
you have resided in Suiyu Pavilion to avoid me.

847
01:6:2,119-->01:6:4,79
Am I right?

848
01:6:7,920-->01:6:10,0
You have treated me with coldness,

849
01:6:10,599-->01:6:12,839
and I have done the same to you.

850
01:6:13,880-->01:6:16,39
Come to think of it,

851
01:6:16,719-->01:6:19,40
if it were not for Consort Hua,

852
01:6:20,559-->01:6:24,159
I would have treated you the same way

853
01:6:25,159-->01:6:27,119
as I treat Consort Xi.

854
01:6:28,760-->01:6:32,919
Your Highness, at last His Majesty is passing the night with Concubine Hui.

855
01:6:35,280-->01:6:37,360
Concubine Hui is thoughtful and kind,

856
01:6:38,719-->01:6:40,640
but His Majesty has ignored her all this time.

857
01:6:42,880-->01:6:47,79
Send a pot of passion wine to their room

858
01:6:47,160-->01:6:48,960
as a gift on my behalf.

859
01:6:50,280-->01:6:51,760
Yes, Your Highness.

860
01:6:54,679-->01:6:57,320
The Empress Dowager knows that His Majesty is with Concubine Hui.

861
01:6:57,399-->01:6:58,399
SUN ZHUXI

862
01:6:58,479-->01:7:0,479
Pleased at heart, she sends you a pot of wine.

863
01:7:0,559-->01:7:4,719
The Queen Mother still thinks of sending wine so late at night.

864
01:7:7,319-->01:7:8,959
What wine is this?

865
01:7:9,39-->01:7:11,519
His Majesty and Concubine Hui are deeply in love.

866
01:7:11,599-->01:7:15,639
It must be passion wine for conjugal bliss.

867
01:7:17,760-->01:7:19,519
I am grateful for the Queen Mother's concern.

868
01:7:23,79-->01:7:25,120
I will excuse myself now.

869
01:7:31,359-->01:7:34,159
If we were truly in love,

870
01:7:35,280-->01:7:37,360
we would not need this wine.

871
01:7:38,159-->01:7:40,79
We still have a long way ahead.

872
01:7:41,679-->01:7:45,999
I will visit you again when there is no longer any doubt in your mind.

873
01:7:47,520-->01:7:48,799
I will return to Yangxin Hall.

874
01:7:51,360-->01:7:53,439
His Majesty departs!

875
01:7:54,319-->01:7:55,640
Your Majesty!

876
01:7:55,719-->01:7:57,320
Hold on to His Majesty!

877
01:8:1,919-->01:8:4,320
My heart has withered.

878
01:8:4,400-->01:8:7,800
What good can such heartfelt words do me?

879
01:8:19,240-->01:8:21,40
See,

880
01:8:21,120-->01:8:22,879
even the Empress Dowager knows

881
01:8:24,0-->01:8:25,600
that without this passion wine,

882
01:8:27,880-->01:8:30,199
nothing will ever take place between us.

883
01:8:35,920-->01:8:38,640
What of my feelings?

884
01:8:43,280-->01:8:45,479
My own feelings.

885
01:8:47,279-->01:8:49,359
Does he know them?

886
01:8:52,680-->01:8:54,920
Even if he did,

887
01:8:56,560-->01:8:59,880
he would never care about me.

888
01:9:3,399-->01:9:5,760
Wen Shichu!

889
01:9:16,479-->01:9:18,240
Shichu!

890
01:9:23,239-->01:9:25,520
Young mistress, you are drunk. Please cease drinking.

891
01:9:25,600-->01:9:28,39
What is the use of restraint?

892
01:9:28,640-->01:9:31,479
Can I not indulge myself for once?

893
01:9:33,719-->01:9:35,399
Wen Shichu!

894
01:9:37,359-->01:9:40,920
I will send for Doctor Wen at once to help you sober up, my lady.

895
01:9:41,759-->01:9:45,600
Master Wen, you are still packing medicine for Consort Xi at this late hour.

896
01:9:45,680-->01:9:47,680
This is not for Consort Xi.

897
01:9:47,760-->01:9:50,279
Concubine Hui always loses her appetite in summer.

898
01:9:50,359-->01:9:51,439
WEI LIN

899
01:9:51,520-->01:9:53,159
This medicine is to whet her appetite.

900
01:9:53,239-->01:9:55,39
- Have you written everything down? - Yes, sir.

901
01:9:57,119-->01:9:59,600
Doctor Wen, Caiyue requests that you visit Suiyu Pavilion immediately.

902
01:9:59,680-->01:10:1,880
Concubine Hui has drunk too much and needs medicine to sober up.

903
01:10:1,960-->01:10:3,719
I shall go at once.

904
01:10:5,279-->01:10:8,479
My lady, why have you drunk so much?

905
01:10:11,680-->01:10:13,359
You are here.

906
01:10:13,439-->01:10:15,239
It is harmful to your health.

907
01:10:15,319-->01:10:18,160
Concubine Hui, why do you make yourself suffer?

908
01:10:18,240-->01:10:20,159
Concubine Hui!

909
01:10:21,40-->01:10:23,720
Do I not have my own name?

910
01:10:23,800-->01:10:25,399
I--

911
01:10:25,479-->01:10:26,680
Please do not say such things.

912
01:10:31,439-->01:10:32,640
Sit down.

913
01:10:33,680-->01:10:35,40
Yes, my lady.

914
01:10:36,40-->01:10:38,400
I have a pot of good wine here.

915
01:10:39,759-->01:10:41,80
Have some.

916
01:10:42,600-->01:10:44,80
My lady, I dare not.

917
01:10:44,800-->01:10:50,199
I did not know I had no one to drink and talk with.

918
01:10:51,599-->01:10:53,40
My lady,

919
01:10:54,720-->01:10:57,640
I will do as you command.

920
01:11:2,79-->01:11:4,399
It is said that drinking is pleasurable,

921
01:11:5,720-->01:11:10,0
but I still feel lonely after drinking.

922
01:11:11,239-->01:11:13,39
Aside from Huan,

923
01:11:13,119-->01:11:15,680
I have no one else.

924
01:11:18,560-->01:11:21,999
Please do not speak like this, my lady. I know you are distressed.

925
01:11:22,79-->01:11:25,39
Please tell me everything.

926
01:11:25,120-->01:11:26,720
I will listen to you.

927
01:11:27,439-->01:11:31,239
Are we not the same?

928
01:11:33,119-->01:11:36,999
We ignore our own feelings in order to protect those we love.

929
01:11:39,319-->01:11:41,239
You and I,

930
01:11:43,439-->01:11:45,399
are we not the same?

931
01:11:56,159-->01:11:59,80
You and I are true companions, my lady.

932
01:12:13,119-->01:12:15,279
We are true companions.

933
01:12:18,999-->01:12:20,720
My lady!

934
01:12:25,800-->01:12:27,39
What is the matter?

935
01:12:28,800-->01:12:29,839
My lady.

936
01:13:6,799-->01:13:9,319
The flowers of the silk tree are beautiful.

937
01:13:10,79-->01:13:11,759
However beautiful they are,

938
01:13:12,560-->01:13:13,960
in this heavy rain,

939
01:13:14,39-->01:13:16,119
they are doomed to fall.

940
01:13:19,279-->01:13:22,439
My lady, please step back. It is frigid here.

941
01:13:22,520-->01:13:24,560
Who is that?

942
01:13:24,640-->01:13:26,119
Invite her to take shelter from the rain.

943
01:13:26,200-->01:13:28,39
I will have a look, my lady.

944
01:13:30,319-->01:13:32,800
Lady Ning.

945
01:13:32,880-->01:13:35,279
My lady invites you to take shelter from the rain.

946
01:13:38,400-->01:13:40,39
Come.

947
01:13:40,120-->01:13:42,119
My lady, it is Lady Ning.

948
01:13:42,720-->01:13:47,479
- May blessings be with you, Consort Xi. - You are soaked. Jinxi, get her a coat.

949
01:13:49,359-->01:13:52,79
My lady, take care.

950
01:13:53,319-->01:13:54,920
You are fond of silk tree flowers.

951
01:13:56,439-->01:13:59,39
I will ask the servants to put a cloth under that tree.

952
01:13:59,119-->01:14:2,399
When the rain stops and the water drains, the petals will be sent to your residence.

953
01:14:2,479-->01:14:5,79
- You need not be exposed to the rain. - Thank you, my lady.

954
01:14:7,120-->01:14:10,239
You are a Noble Lady. Why are there no servants with you?

955
01:14:11,39-->01:14:14,439
When the rain ceases, shall I escort you?

956
01:14:14,520-->01:14:17,800
No other concubine ever wishes to enter Chunxi Hall.

957
01:14:17,880-->01:14:20,520
Why do you wish to visit my humble residence?

958
01:14:20,600-->01:14:22,560
Am I not welcome, Lady Ning?

959
01:14:26,759-->01:14:28,319
I bow before Consort Xi.

960
01:14:34,199-->01:14:35,680
Please sit, my lady.

961
01:14:44,639-->01:14:47,520
Your cat is well trained, Lady Ning.

962
01:14:47,600-->01:14:50,40
There is nothing special about this clumsy cat.

963
01:14:51,239-->01:14:53,40
Where is Tuanrong?

964
01:15:1,439-->01:15:4,999
The cat is calm and gentle.

965
01:15:5,600-->01:15:7,359
And most intelligent.

966
01:15:7,439-->01:15:9,319
She rarely makes a noise,

967
01:15:9,399-->01:15:10,479
but when she does,

968
01:15:10,560-->01:15:13,600
she can draw all the cats in the neighborhood here.

969
01:15:15,800-->01:15:17,640
Are you afraid of cats, my lady?

970
01:15:17,719-->01:15:18,719
No.

971
01:15:18,799-->01:15:23,0
I am merely curious how one tames such an intelligent animal.

972
01:15:25,640-->01:15:29,720
Before I became a horse trainer, I used to be an animal trainer.

973
01:15:29,800-->01:15:32,359
It took no effort to tame this one.

974
01:15:42,520-->01:15:46,239
For what reason did you send for me, young mistress?

975
01:15:46,319-->01:15:48,439
A question troubles my mind.

976
01:15:48,520-->01:15:51,920
Please feel my pulse and tell me the answer.

977
01:15:52,520-->01:15:53,560
Yes, my lady.

978
01:15:57,119-->01:15:58,720
Young mistress!

979
01:15:58,800-->01:16:2,800
My dream seems to have come true.

980
01:16:4,960-->01:16:8,159
Could it be from what happened that night?

981
01:16:17,600-->01:16:20,479
You need not warn me of guilt by association.

982
01:16:21,760-->01:16:24,159
This is my child.

983
01:16:24,840-->01:16:28,839
I will keep him safe whether it means my life or death.

984
01:16:30,279-->01:16:33,760
Shichu, please help me.

985
01:16:33,840-->01:16:38,560
Do not turn this dream into a nightmare.

986
01:16:44,0-->01:16:46,760
Are you certain that His Majesty exits the imperial counsel at this hour?

987
01:16:46,840-->01:16:48,640
Yes, I am certain of it, my lady.

988
01:16:48,719-->01:16:52,680
Then search intently for my lost bracelet.

989
01:16:56,680-->01:17:0,520
What are you searching for at such an early hour?

990
01:17:0,600-->01:17:2,719
I bow before Your Majesty.

991
01:17:4,399-->01:17:6,399
I discovered that my bracelet was missing.

992
01:17:6,479-->01:17:7,520
It would not matter

993
01:17:8,120-->01:17:11,439
were it not the one Your Majesty gave to me in my first year here.

994
01:17:11,520-->01:17:13,439
I am loath to give it up.

995
01:17:13,520-->01:17:15,119
- Su Peisheng. - Yes, sir.

996
01:17:15,199-->01:17:17,240
- Help search for it. - Yes, Your Majesty.

997
01:17:21,439-->01:17:25,279
You seldom wear dresses of such delicate color.

998
01:17:25,359-->01:17:29,39
Delicate but not coquettish. You do look lovely.

999
01:17:29,119-->01:17:33,600
This dress is blessed to have found favor with you.

1000
01:17:35,40-->01:17:37,40
Your Majesty, the bracelet has been found.

1001
01:17:43,680-->01:17:47,640
Do not go searching if it is lost again. We have many in the storehouse.

1002
01:17:47,719-->01:17:50,439
The bracelet can be lost, but not the affection.

1003
01:17:50,520-->01:17:53,520
I have prepared your favorite tea in Suiyu Pavilion.

1004
01:17:53,600-->01:17:55,640
Would you care for some?

1005
01:17:55,720-->01:17:57,720
How can I refuse your invitation?

1006
01:18:3,560-->01:18:5,960
And pigs may well fly!

1007
01:18:13,880-->01:18:17,560
Your Majesty, the plum soup looks appetizing.

1008
01:18:17,640-->01:18:21,599
- Please ask Consort Xi to give me some. - I know you enjoy wine.

1009
01:18:22,199-->01:18:25,600
Su Peisheng, fill the cup of Concubine Hui.

1010
01:18:25,680-->01:18:26,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

1011
01:18:30,479-->01:18:35,240
Your Majesty, I should not drink for I am with child.

1012
01:18:37,479-->01:18:40,640
When did this happen? How many months has it been?

1013
01:18:40,720-->01:18:43,39
I felt ill yesterday,

1014
01:18:43,119-->01:18:47,79
so I sent for Doctor Wen and was told of my two-month pregnancy.

1015
01:18:47,960-->01:18:52,600
That is correct. It has been two months.

1016
01:18:53,640-->01:18:57,199
The chrysanthemums have blossomed very early this summer.

1017
01:18:58,760-->01:19:0,999
I was worried it was an ill omen,

1018
01:19:1,960-->01:19:5,520
but it turns out to be a good one.

1019
01:19:6,439-->01:19:9,439
Huan and Mei are now pregnant.

1020
01:19:10,359-->01:19:14,80
Such a joyous coincidence has never happened before.

1021
01:19:15,760-->01:19:17,999
How is the Empress?

1022
01:19:18,79-->01:19:21,359
She should soon recover from her severe headaches.

1023
01:19:22,439-->01:19:27,520
If she recovers, I will face endless troubles.

1024
01:19:30,560-->01:19:33,359
All suppose I am eight months pregnant.

1025
01:19:33,960-->01:19:37,479
We must prepare for the last resort.

1026
01:19:38,520-->01:19:42,119
Do not worry, my lady. Everything is well prepared.

1027
01:19:44,80-->01:19:46,919
I will soon be in labor,

1028
01:19:47,520-->01:19:50,640
but Concubine Hui is far from stable with her three-month pregnancy.

1029
01:19:50,720-->01:19:54,800
Please take particular care of Concubine Hui and her child.

1030
01:19:55,920-->01:19:59,319
I shall spare no effort and pass through fire and water for them.

1031
01:20:4,960-->01:20:7,40
I am late.

1032
01:20:8,720-->01:20:13,319
- Please forgive me, Your Majesty. - Be at ease for this family feast. Sit.

1033
01:20:19,760-->01:20:23,520
I greet Concubine Hui. I have not yet congratulated you.

1034
01:20:23,600-->01:20:25,439
Thank you, my lord.

1035
01:20:27,959-->01:20:29,960
I greet Consort Xi.

1036
01:20:36,159-->01:20:37,959
My respects, my lord.

1037
01:20:38,560-->01:20:42,159
You will be in labor soon. Are you in good health, my lady?

1038
01:20:42,239-->01:20:44,560
I am well. Thank you for your concern, my lord.

1039
01:20:52,239-->01:20:54,800
Your Majesty, Consort Xi must take her medication.

1040
01:20:54,879-->01:20:56,119
Make haste then.

1041
01:20:56,920-->01:20:58,919
I shall return shortly.

1042
01:21:4,840-->01:21:6,999
Are you all right, young mistress?

1043
01:21:7,79-->01:21:10,920
I thought I could restrain my affection and forget him,

1044
01:21:11,0-->01:21:12,880
but I almost lost control.

1045
01:21:13,479-->01:21:16,680
I do understand the pain you and His Lordship bear, young mistress.

1046
01:21:28,720-->01:21:30,319
Are you well?

1047
01:21:31,119-->01:21:34,600
As I told you at the feast, all is well.

1048
01:21:36,40-->01:21:39,359
But now it is different. Only the two of us are here.

1049
01:21:40,399-->01:21:43,919
I wish to hear you say it again with all your heart.

1050
01:21:44,0-->01:21:46,600
- Huanbi, we must leave. - Do not go!

1051
01:21:47,840-->01:21:50,640
Let me go.

1052
01:21:51,879-->01:21:52,879
Let me go!

1053
01:22:3,40-->01:22:5,240
I feel that you are not at all living a happy life

1054
01:22:6,439-->01:22:10,200
though Yongshou Palace glitters like gold.

1055
01:22:12,439-->01:22:14,839
Whether a golden palace or a thatched cottage,

1056
01:22:15,439-->01:22:17,479
I chose it of my own accord.

1057
01:22:18,760-->01:22:20,79
My lord,

1058
01:22:21,79-->01:22:24,239
please do not be grieved over a person who is undeserving of your affection.

1059
01:22:25,640-->01:22:29,239
If we delay any longer, His Majesty will be alarmed.

1060
01:22:41,0-->01:22:42,959
Take good care of yourself.

1061
01:22:45,639-->01:22:46,719
And you.

1062
01:22:49,279-->01:22:52,120
To avoid suspicion, I shall return first.

1063
01:22:52,199-->01:22:54,439
Then wait a while and come in after me.

1064
01:23:6,279-->01:23:7,319
Who's there?

1065
01:23:7,720-->01:23:9,879
Huanbi, what is it?

1066
01:23:9,959-->01:23:12,239
I saw a shadow there, my lady.

1067
01:23:25,600-->01:23:28,239
Where have these cats come from? Protect Consort Xi!

1068
01:23:28,319-->01:23:31,239
Cats! Hurry!

1069
01:23:31,319-->01:23:32,719
Hurry!

1070
01:23:37,479-->01:23:39,279
Mistress, are you hurt?

1071
01:23:40,319-->01:23:42,80
It hurts!

1072
01:23:42,159-->01:23:44,160
What should we do?

1073
01:23:44,800-->01:23:47,600
Push, my lady, with all your strength!

1074
01:23:47,680-->01:23:50,120
Push hard, my lady!

1075
01:23:53,120-->01:23:54,759
Hurry to see if the labor medicine is ready.

1076
01:23:54,840-->01:23:57,640
Remember it must be thick for Consort Xi to take.

1077
01:23:57,720-->01:23:58,720
Yes, Doctor.

1078
01:24:0,80-->01:24:3,479
My lady, I must ask you a question.

1079
01:24:3,560-->01:24:8,640
Should an accident occur, do you wish to save yourself or the baby?

1080
01:24:9,879-->01:24:14,80
Wen Shichu, we are lifelong friends.

1081
01:24:14,160-->01:24:16,359
You must promise me

1082
01:24:17,199-->01:24:19,279
not to hurt my child,

1083
01:24:19,879-->01:24:22,159
cost what it may.

1084
01:24:22,239-->01:24:23,359
Do you hear me?

1085
01:24:23,439-->01:24:25,79
Don't even think about it!

1086
01:24:25,560-->01:24:29,439
I told you that Consort Xi and her child must both be safe,

1087
01:24:29,520-->01:24:32,319
or the entire Medical Bureau shall be buried with them!

1088
01:24:33,680-->01:24:38,959
I have had enough punishment. Another child of mine must not be lost.

1089
01:25:1,840-->01:25:3,439
The young mistress is awake.

1090
01:25:5,199-->01:25:6,199
My child.

1091
01:25:7,199-->01:25:8,200
Where is my child?

1092
01:25:8,279-->01:25:11,920
The wet nurse is feeding them. They shall return soon, my lady.

1093
01:25:12,880-->01:25:14,279
They are boy-girl twins.

1094
01:25:14,360-->01:25:18,880
Huan Huan, you have given me a dragon and a phoenix of good fortune.

1095
01:25:21,320-->01:25:23,400
Did Mei come?

1096
01:25:23,479-->01:25:26,880
And where is Doctor Wen?

1097
01:25:26,959-->01:25:31,199
Concubine Hui cannot visit you for her pregnancy. I asked her to rest.

1098
01:25:31,279-->01:25:34,119
Doctor Wen is directing the others to prepare medicine in the back.

1099
01:25:34,600-->01:25:38,359
Huan Huan, you have given me two children at once,

1100
01:25:38,439-->01:25:40,479
a praiseworthy accomplishment.

1101
01:25:40,560-->01:25:43,319
I grant you the title of Noble Consort,

1102
01:25:43,399-->01:25:46,800
and you shall be my favorite of all.

1103
01:25:47,399-->01:25:52,640
In my heart, no one deserves this title except for you.

1104
01:25:53,879-->01:25:56,720
Why do you shiver so suddenly? Are you cold?

1105
01:25:57,520-->01:25:59,880
Feiwen, she just gave birth. How could you open the windows?

1106
01:25:59,960-->01:26:1,560
She might catch cold. Close them now!

1107
01:26:3,40-->01:26:6,840
Your Majesty, the midwife said the hall smelled of blood,

1108
01:26:6,920-->01:26:9,600
so I left the windows open at her request.

1109
01:26:9,679-->01:26:12,600
How dare you retort after a misdeed! Slap her in the face 20 times.

1110
01:26:12,680-->01:26:14,199
Yes, Your Majesty.

1111
01:26:15,600-->01:26:17,119
- Su Peisheng! - Yes, sir.

1112
01:26:17,199-->01:26:18,680
Issue a decree to the Imperial Harem.

1113
01:26:18,760-->01:26:22,319
Consort Xi of Yongshou Palace is promoted to Noble Consort Xi.

1114
01:26:23,239-->01:26:26,839
The conferring ceremony will be held on the day the Prince turns one month old.

1115
01:26:26,920-->01:26:28,319
Yes, Your Majesty.

1116
01:26:28,399-->01:26:29,880
His Majesty is listening inside.

1117
01:26:29,960-->01:26:31,960
Do it yourself. I might hit you too hard.

1118
01:26:32,40-->01:26:35,359
Eunuch Yun, you heard as well. It is truly not my fault.

1119
01:26:36,159-->01:26:39,0
I merely did as I was told.

1120
01:26:39,79-->01:26:41,520
His Majesty vents his anger out of concern for Noble Consort Xi.

1121
01:26:41,600-->01:26:43,159
Do not take it to heart.

1122
01:26:43,239-->01:26:46,960
His Majesty should not do that simply out of his love for her.

1123
01:26:47,40-->01:26:50,439
Mind your words! If His Majesty hears, you shall be punished more severely.

1124
01:27:11,479-->01:27:14,119
I bid farewell to Your Highness.

1125
01:27:14,199-->01:27:16,479
What happened to your face?

1126
01:27:16,560-->01:27:18,600
I was at fault.

1127
01:27:27,600-->01:27:30,639
Feiwen, where are you going?

1128
01:27:30,720-->01:27:33,799
Huanbi ordered me to fetch provisions from the Imperial Household Department.

1129
01:27:33,880-->01:27:36,680
I am heading there too. Shall we go together?

1130
01:27:41,159-->01:27:44,880
I was already a Noble Consort at that time,

1131
01:27:44,960-->01:27:47,800
in a lofty position,

1132
01:27:47,880-->01:27:50,479
having won His Majesty's highest favor.

1133
01:27:50,560-->01:27:53,159
I had nothing to worry about.

1134
01:27:54,279-->01:27:59,680
Little did I know that the worst was yet to come.

1135
01:27:59,760-->01:28:6,79
Empress Wenyu is truly hateful, fearful and pitiful.

1136
01:28:6,680-->01:28:11,680
She would never let slip away the chance to drag another down.
