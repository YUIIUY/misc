1
00:02:12,560-->00:02:14,159
I am moved by Xiao Yunzi.

2
00:02:14,240-->00:02:18,360
He has served me since I entered the palace, his loyalty absolute.

3
00:02:18,439-->00:02:22,199
It is rare to find a true friend,

4
00:02:22,279-->00:02:24,599
let alone a servant of such loyalty.

5
00:02:24,679-->00:02:28,639
Such are Jinxi, Huanbi and Liuzhu. They have been entirely devoted.

6
00:02:29,240-->00:02:33,479
Yet those in the palace are fickle. They curry favor with the powerful.

7
00:02:33,560-->00:02:36,800
Not a single one refuses to follow along blindly.

8
00:02:37,480-->00:02:42,79
I have always been obstinate, refusing to subject myself to another.

9
00:02:42,159-->00:02:44,519
In my moment of distress when I fell into disgrace,

10
00:02:44,599-->00:02:48,719
were it not for these loyal servants, devoted in heart and soul,

11
00:02:48,800-->00:02:54,319
I likely would have met the same fate as Consort Hua.

12
00:02:59,800-->00:03:03,199
My lady, congratulations. Please make a wish by flying a kite.

13
00:03:10,960-->00:03:12,560
Your Majesty, look.

14
00:03:26,280-->00:03:29,519
I can't believe there are so many lotus blossoms in April.

15
00:03:34,960-->00:03:36,0
Now listen.

16
00:03:40,80-->00:03:41,800
"Two phoenixes on the wing."

17
00:03:42,720-->00:03:45,0
It sounds so graceful on the flute.

18
00:03:51,960-->00:03:54,639
A pair of phoenixes on the wing glide in perfect harmony,

19
00:03:55,840-->00:03:58,0
paired in a happy marriage filled with peace and joy.

20
00:03:58,80-->00:04:00,79
Every woman in the world dreams of such a match.

21
00:04:00,759-->00:04:02,760
Has your dream come true?

22
00:04:16,920-->00:04:18,439
In honor of Concubine Wan's birthday

23
00:04:18,519-->00:04:21,120
I present a pond filled with lotus blossoms.

24
00:04:21,200-->00:04:23,640
My lord, you have outdone yourself. I am honored.

25
00:04:24,519-->00:04:26,480
I told you to devise a novel idea.

26
00:04:26,560-->00:04:29,160
I never imagined it would be so extraordinary.

27
00:04:29,839-->00:04:31,839
You asked me to plan a celebration for Concubine Wan.

28
00:04:31,920-->00:04:34,720
I, your brother, would surely do my utmost.

29
00:04:34,800-->00:04:39,120
I'm curious how you managed to make the lotuses bloom in this season.

30
00:04:39,200-->00:04:41,120
The lotus roots were planted some time ago.

31
00:04:41,199-->00:04:42,839
I made them bloom by diverting water from

32
00:04:42,920-->00:04:45,399
a hot spring outside the palace into the pond.

33
00:04:46,600-->00:04:47,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

34
00:05:02,880-->00:05:05,160
Huan, you've returned.

35
00:05:05,240-->00:05:07,839
You come at a good time. I was just thinking of you.

36
00:05:07,920-->00:05:11,279
I've used almost all of the healing balm. I wanted to ask you for more.

37
00:05:11,360-->00:05:13,319
What a coincidence. I thought the very same thing.

38
00:05:14,160-->00:05:17,240
- You see, I've brought some with me. - I keep troubling you.

39
00:05:17,320-->00:05:18,879
I've already used three or four containers.

40
00:05:18,959-->00:05:21,359
But I still need you to make some more.

41
00:05:21,439-->00:05:23,439
Huan, you're expecting a child. Please sit down.

42
00:05:24,480-->00:05:26,120
I am simply idle.

43
00:05:26,199-->00:05:29,79
It is wonderful to be able to use my skills for your sake.

44
00:05:29,160-->00:05:30,759
Don't tire yourself.

45
00:05:31,360-->00:05:33,359
His Majesty the Emperor!

46
00:05:34,199-->00:05:35,519
Huan Huan.

47
00:05:36,319-->00:05:38,640
Your Majesty, may blessings and peace be with you.

48
00:05:38,720-->00:05:41,0
- Rise. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

49
00:05:42,880-->00:05:46,600
I've told you not to move needlessly. Why do you bother to kneel?

50
00:05:46,680-->00:05:49,279
You stood up so quickly. What if you slipped and fell?

51
00:05:49,359-->00:05:51,359
I am not so fragile.

52
00:05:51,439-->00:05:53,959
Huan, since His Majesty now accompanies you,

53
00:05:54,40-->00:05:56,279
I will excuse myself.

54
00:06:05,639-->00:06:06,720
The Empress and I will go to

55
00:06:06,799-->00:06:08,920
the Temple of Heaven for a prayer ceremony.

56
00:06:09,519-->00:06:12,360
In the meantime, Consort Hua will be in charge of the harem.

57
00:06:12,440-->00:06:14,679
I know you are often at odds with her.

58
00:06:14,759-->00:06:17,279
You must yield to her if she makes things difficult.

59
00:06:17,360-->00:06:18,839
If you are aggrieved, tell me upon my return.

60
00:06:18,919-->00:06:20,720
I understand.

61
00:06:20,800-->00:06:24,439
You carry a child now. Don't go to Yikun Palace unless needed.

62
00:06:25,480-->00:06:28,800
I will take extra care. Please rest easy, Your Majesty.

63
00:06:28,880-->00:06:31,240
It is out of deep concern that I must keep enjoining you.

64
00:06:34,959-->00:06:38,160
His Imperial Majesty and Her Highness the Empress depart!

65
00:06:39,360-->00:06:43,360
Your Majesty and Your Highness, we see you off in respect.

66
00:06:57,679-->00:06:59,720
No matter how long I sleep, I remain weary.

67
00:06:59,800-->00:07:01,800
I feel sore around the waist.

68
00:07:03,320-->00:07:05,399
Young mistress, is anything wrong?

69
00:07:05,480-->00:07:07,359
It is nothing.

70
00:07:07,439-->00:07:10,839
I have often been to Consort Hua's palace

71
00:07:10,920-->00:07:12,599
to receive instruction these past few days.

72
00:07:13,199-->00:07:15,720
I don't know what kind of incense is burned there.

73
00:07:15,800-->00:07:18,160
I find the smell pungent.

74
00:07:18,240-->00:07:21,439
Consort Hua is fond of the incense, especially in great quantities.

75
00:07:21,519-->00:07:23,279
It is fragrant only from a distance.

76
00:07:24,439-->00:07:27,920
I think I will ask Xiao Yunzi to send for Doctor Zhang.

77
00:07:28,0-->00:07:30,480
- Return as soon as possible. - Yes, Mistress.

78
00:07:34,919-->00:07:38,680
- I bow in respect before Concubine Wan. - You may rise.

79
00:07:40,239-->00:07:41,839
By order of Consort Hua,

80
00:07:41,920-->00:07:45,720
Concubine Wan must report to Yikun Palace to listen to her words.

81
00:07:45,800-->00:07:47,760
I would not fail to attend,

82
00:07:48,359-->00:07:49,999
but I am not well today.

83
00:07:50,639-->00:07:52,640
Could you convey my apologies to Consort Hua?

84
00:07:52,719-->00:07:55,279
By His Majesty's decree, Consort Hua is in charge of the harem.

85
00:07:55,879-->00:07:59,519
My lady, you should not disregard His Majesty's orders.

86
00:08:02,159-->00:08:04,560
- Is the Empress Dowager recovering? - She remains the same.

87
00:08:04,640-->00:08:07,919
She keeps coughing after nightfall and cannot sleep through the night.

88
00:08:19,239-->00:08:20,839
I bow in respect before Consort Hua.

89
00:08:21,439-->00:08:25,240
I was unwell this morning. I arrive late. My lady, please forgive me.

90
00:08:25,320-->00:08:26,399
You may rise.

91
00:08:32,320-->00:08:36,399
There have been a number of quarrels among the maids and eunuchs recently.

92
00:08:36,480-->00:08:38,480
If not for the favor their mistresses enjoy,

93
00:08:38,559-->00:08:40,199
they would never dare behave this way.

94
00:08:41,279-->00:08:46,159
They have surely been influenced by the improper behavior of their mistresses.

95
00:08:46,879-->00:08:48,399
Concubine Wan.

96
00:08:49,359-->00:08:51,200
Do you acknowledge your error?

97
00:08:55,240-->00:08:58,960
Today all the concubines have gathered here to receive instruction.

98
00:08:59,39-->00:09:03,0
Concubine Wan arrives late needlessly and displays contempt for her superiors.

99
00:09:03,80-->00:09:04,320
Kneel at once!

100
00:09:11,679-->00:09:13,120
I acknowledge my error.

101
00:09:13,200-->00:09:14,879
Concubine Wan of the Zhen family

102
00:09:14,960-->00:09:16,840
has offended her superiors and affronted me.

103
00:09:16,920-->00:09:21,200
As punishment, she must kneel outdoors and read the Admonitions for Women aloud.

104
00:09:22,80-->00:09:24,440
My lady, the sun shines fiercely at this hour

105
00:09:24,520-->00:09:26,80
and the granite is extremely hard.

106
00:09:26,159-->00:09:28,880
Concubine Wan carries a child. You cannot order her to kneel.

107
00:09:30,640-->00:09:32,360
My lady, please forgive her.

108
00:09:32,440-->00:09:35,720
For the sake of her unborn child, please forgive her, my lady.

109
00:09:36,280-->00:09:39,839
It is your right to punish Concubine Wan, but if His Majesty's child is harmed,

110
00:09:39,919-->00:09:43,440
you will surely be castigated when His Majesty and the Empress return.

111
00:09:43,520-->00:09:47,320
Do you think you can threaten me with His Majesty and the Empress?

112
00:09:49,159-->00:09:51,240
Of course I must be punished for my error.

113
00:09:51,320-->00:09:54,919
But I carry His Majesty's child. I truly cannot kneel for long durations.

114
00:09:55,679-->00:09:57,440
My lady, please reconsider.

115
00:09:58,120-->00:09:59,920
Do you take me for a fool?

116
00:10:00,679-->00:10:03,919
You have been quite well during pregnancy and you are already past three months.

117
00:10:03,999-->00:10:06,519
Your condition should be stable by now.

118
00:10:06,600-->00:10:08,279
I have already consulted the imperial doctors.

119
00:10:08,359-->00:10:11,480
Kneeling for two hours should cause no harm to a pregnant woman.

120
00:10:17,759-->00:10:19,159
- How dare you! - Kneel.

121
00:10:19,239-->00:10:21,80
Don't.

122
00:10:22,0-->00:10:23,519
Young mistress.

123
00:10:25,359-->00:10:26,960
I will accept your punishment

124
00:10:27,760-->00:10:31,39
only because you were left in charge of the harem by imperial decree.

125
00:10:31,119-->00:10:35,160
True justice exists in the heart of man. It cannot be imposed through punishment.

126
00:10:36,559-->00:10:39,520
Very well. Now we will see

127
00:10:39,600-->00:10:43,79
whether true justice is imposed by my command

128
00:10:43,159-->00:10:45,679
or exists in what you call the heart of man.

129
00:10:48,960-->00:10:52,479
Read it aloud, word-for-word, until I am satisfied.

130
00:10:57,639-->00:11:00,39
Concubine Wan is pregnant. It is improper for her to kneel.

131
00:11:00,120-->00:11:03,279
Should pregnant concubines be allowed to defy the palace rules?

132
00:11:03,360-->00:11:05,360
Since you are so eager to intercede,

133
00:11:05,440-->00:11:07,399
why don't you kneel and join her?

134
00:11:07,479-->00:11:09,799
Lady Hui is not trying to intercede.

135
00:11:09,880-->00:11:11,880
My lady, please do not vent your anger on her.

136
00:11:11,960-->00:11:15,759
If I insist on doing so, what say do you have in the matter?

137
00:11:15,840-->00:11:17,959
Kneel beside her and hold the book in your hands.

138
00:11:18,39-->00:11:21,600
Let her read it aloud. She may even learn something.

139
00:11:33,799-->00:11:35,0
I am here.

140
00:11:36,960-->00:11:38,559
It's terribly hot.

141
00:11:39,399-->00:11:42,799
Bring chairs for all of the concubines.

142
00:11:43,480-->00:11:49,39
Let them observe what happens to those who defy me.

143
00:11:55,640-->00:11:58,799
Even from beautiful women, the smell of sweat is just as pungent.

144
00:11:59,400-->00:12:03,0
Songzhi, bring out the incense burner.

145
00:12:03,80-->00:12:05,999
Remove these odors by burning more Huanyi Incense.

146
00:12:06,80-->00:12:07,520
Yes, my lady.

147
00:12:07,600-->00:12:11,919
"I was beloved by my late husband, due to instruction from my mother and teacher.

148
00:12:11,999-->00:12:16,119
I married at age 14 and became a member of the Cao family.

149
00:12:16,200-->00:12:18,960
Forty years have passed since then. Trembling with fear--"

150
00:12:19,480-->00:12:21,480
You are not allowed to enter.

151
00:12:22,240-->00:12:24,479
So much time has passed. Why does she still kneel?

152
00:12:24,559-->00:12:26,840
It is too soon for Consort Hua to relent.

153
00:12:34,80-->00:12:35,200
Halt!

154
00:12:35,279-->00:12:37,919
I am from Suiyu Pavilion. I urgently ask to see the Empress Dowager.

155
00:12:37,999-->00:12:39,639
Her Highness is ill. She sleeps after her medicine.

156
00:12:39,720-->00:12:41,80
How dare you disturb her!

157
00:12:41,159-->00:12:43,999
It is a matter of life or death. Please let me enter.

158
00:12:44,80-->00:12:46,479
If you disturb the Empress Dowager, it will cost you your life.

159
00:12:46,559-->00:12:48,479
- Your Highness! - Be gone!

160
00:12:49,80-->00:12:51,640
If not for Suiyu Pavilion, you'd have been beaten already.

161
00:12:51,720-->00:12:53,159
Be gone!

162
00:12:53,240-->00:12:56,480
- Huanbi, what is it? - A Jin, where is the Marquess?

163
00:12:57,359-->00:12:59,920
"Humility and delicacy are foremost.

164
00:13:00,0-->00:13:01,960
In ancient times, female infants were placed

165
00:13:02,39-->00:13:03,879
under the bed when three days old.

166
00:13:03,960-->00:13:07,479
Spindles and bricks were laid next to them to announce their birth to the ancestors."

167
00:13:07,559-->00:13:09,479
- Servants. - Yes, my lady.

168
00:13:09,559-->00:13:11,80
Beat them.

169
00:13:12,159-->00:13:14,840
One of them is with child and may not be beaten, so beat the other one.

170
00:13:14,920-->00:13:16,479
Yes, my lady.

171
00:13:17,399-->00:13:19,440
- Don't beat her. - Young mistress, careful.

172
00:13:20,320-->00:13:22,679
- Young mistress, watch out! - Don't beat her!

173
00:13:23,840-->00:13:25,40
Young mistress.

174
00:13:25,120-->00:13:26,799
My lady.

175
00:13:26,880-->00:13:29,719
If you grow listless again, your good friend

176
00:13:29,799-->00:13:31,960
will take another beating for you.

177
00:13:32,39-->00:13:36,480
My lady, I am truly not well.

178
00:13:39,160-->00:13:41,919
Just look at her, everyone. How foolish she is.

179
00:13:41,999-->00:13:45,640
She feigns illness just as Lady Fucha did

180
00:13:45,720-->00:13:48,760
not realizing that the same excuse becomes worn out from overuse.

181
00:13:48,840-->00:13:50,679
Why don't you try something new?

182
00:13:56,39-->00:13:57,879
My lady, Huan is very weak.

183
00:13:58,520-->00:14:01,720
If she collapses from heatstroke, you won't be able to bear the blame.

184
00:14:02,599-->00:14:06,600
I intend to find out whether she will collapse.

185
00:14:06,679-->00:14:09,239
Zhou Ninghai, burn some mint and mugwort.

186
00:14:09,320-->00:14:10,320
Yes, my lady.

187
00:14:10,400-->00:14:13,520
If she collapses from heatstroke even after burning these herbs,

188
00:14:13,599-->00:14:16,200
I will consider it an act of intentional deception.

189
00:14:16,279-->00:14:19,919
Even though I cannot punish you,

190
00:14:20,0-->00:14:22,999
I will never spare Lady Hui or Attendant An

191
00:14:23,80-->00:14:24,759
who are party to your devious ways.

192
00:14:32,440-->00:14:35,80
My lady, it has been an hour already.

193
00:14:35,160-->00:14:38,359
No hurry. She must continue to kneel for another quarter hour.

194
00:14:38,440-->00:14:41,440
My lady, Concubine Wan already looks pale.

195
00:14:42,40-->00:14:45,559
Is she making this disingenuous display for my benefit?

196
00:14:46,559-->00:14:49,80
I wager that she is in perfectly good health.

197
00:14:49,879-->00:14:51,640
- Huan. - Young mistress.

198
00:14:51,720-->00:14:52,720
Huan.

199
00:14:53,200-->00:14:55,279
- Young mistress. - Huan, are you all right?

200
00:14:56,559-->00:14:58,559
Out of the way!

201
00:14:59,400-->00:15:01,519
- Huan. - Young mistress.

202
00:15:02,840-->00:15:04,840
- Marquess Guo? - Young mistress, what is it?

203
00:15:05,679-->00:15:07,720
He dares intrude into Yikun Palace.

204
00:15:08,320-->00:15:10,679
Stop! Where are you taking Concubine Wan?

205
00:15:10,760-->00:15:13,919
You must know that intruding into the harem is a capital crime.

206
00:15:13,999-->00:15:16,679
That will be for His Majesty to determine.

207
00:15:17,360-->00:15:20,799
I cannot stand by while the imperial heir is harmed.

208
00:15:21,799-->00:15:24,239
If I am punished someday, as you say,

209
00:15:24,320-->00:15:26,799
I will have a clear conscience and no regrets.

210
00:15:27,639-->00:15:29,240
Stop!

211
00:15:32,480-->00:15:35,720
My lady, there appears to be blood on the ground.

212
00:15:40,879-->00:15:42,80
Send for the doctor.

213
00:15:42,159-->00:15:44,200
- What happened? - Careful.

214
00:15:44,279-->00:15:46,39
The blanket.

215
00:15:48,360-->00:15:49,720
Young mistress.

216
00:15:58,520-->00:16:00,119
Young mistress.

217
00:16:01,240-->00:16:03,279
It was caused by her foolishness.

218
00:16:03,360-->00:16:05,640
She didn't say anything.

219
00:16:05,719-->00:16:08,600
No matter which imperial doctor said she could kneel for an hour,

220
00:16:08,679-->00:16:11,200
you should not have held her there so long.

221
00:16:11,839-->00:16:14,520
Caution is the prudent choice. Some actions cannot be undone.

222
00:16:14,599-->00:16:17,800
Why didn't you stop me? Your hindsight is useless now.

223
00:16:17,879-->00:16:19,240
My lady, please quiet your anger.

224
00:16:19,319-->00:16:23,279
My lady, don't vex yourself. You must care for your health.

225
00:16:23,359-->00:16:27,359
The imperial carriage of the Emperor has just reached Xuanwu Gate.

226
00:16:28,960-->00:16:30,560
So soon?

227
00:16:31,480-->00:16:33,559
Any news from Suiyu Pavilion?

228
00:16:34,600-->00:16:36,200
Did she keep her child?

229
00:16:36,280-->00:16:37,960
The imperial doctors are still gathered at Suiyu Pavilion.

230
00:16:38,40-->00:16:39,440
There is no further news.

231
00:16:42,600-->00:16:44,840
Lady Cao, kind mistress.

232
00:16:44,919-->00:16:49,440
My lady did not mean to embarrass you. Please devise a way to help her.

233
00:16:53,200-->00:16:56,360
My lady, regardless of whether Concubine Wan loses the child,

234
00:16:56,440-->00:16:59,439
if you wish to regain His Majesty's favor in the future,

235
00:17:00,119-->00:17:02,480
then you must submit for the present.

236
00:17:08,960-->00:17:10,439
Huan Huan.

237
00:17:10,839-->00:17:12,79
Huan Huan.

238
00:17:13,920-->00:17:14,959
Are you awake?

239
00:17:15,40-->00:17:17,319
It's a blessing from Heaven you're finally awake.

240
00:17:18,0-->00:17:19,720
You have slept for several hours.

241
00:17:22,400-->00:17:23,999
Your Majesty.

242
00:17:24,960-->00:17:26,240
You have returned.

243
00:17:34,200-->00:17:35,599
Huan Huan.

244
00:17:37,79-->00:17:38,680
I am deeply sorry.

245
00:17:39,600-->00:17:41,319
I am deeply sorry.

246
00:17:42,319-->00:17:43,920
Your Majesty.

247
00:17:46,79-->00:17:47,439
My child--

248
00:17:48,39-->00:17:50,199
Is my child all right?

249
00:17:52,400-->00:17:54,880
We will have another child someday.

250
00:18:01,39-->00:18:02,640
Young mistress.

251
00:18:04,279-->00:18:07,999
Your Majesty, my child.

252
00:18:08,79-->00:18:09,680
Your Majesty!

253
00:18:11,640-->00:18:13,680
My child!

254
00:18:17,680-->00:18:20,39
My child!

255
00:18:21,0-->00:18:22,0
Do not cry.

256
00:18:22,79-->00:18:24,640
If you are grieved, His Majesty will feel even deeper grief.

257
00:18:24,719-->00:18:27,999
The imperial carriages returned in haste upon hearing the news.

258
00:18:28,79-->00:18:31,680
Your Majesty, this is no time for mourning.

259
00:18:31,760-->00:18:35,280
Concubine Wan has lost her child through man-made, not natural causes.

260
00:18:43,960-->00:18:45,560
Where is that shrew?

261
00:18:58,519-->00:18:59,840
I greet Your Majesty.

262
00:19:02,880-->00:19:04,479
I am guilty.

263
00:19:05,199-->00:19:07,479
Concubine Wan offended me today.

264
00:19:07,559-->00:19:10,959
I intended to teach her a lesson with a modest punishment.

265
00:19:11,40-->00:19:13,640
I did not mean to harm her unborn child.

266
00:19:13,719-->00:19:15,839
I don't even understand how such a thing could happen.

267
00:19:15,920-->00:19:20,480
I hope that Your Majesty will forgive my ignorance.

268
00:19:20,559-->00:19:21,640
Your ignorance?

269
00:19:22,279-->00:19:27,160
You knew that Concubine Wan was pregnant and yet you insisted on punishing her!

270
00:19:28,359-->00:19:31,519
And you didn't regret it afterward!

271
00:19:32,200-->00:19:33,359
Vile wench!

272
00:19:35,599-->00:19:37,759
It was caused by my ignorance.

273
00:19:37,839-->00:19:40,160
I do not believe that you are ignorant.

274
00:19:40,239-->00:19:42,240
Yet you are indeed quite vicious.

275
00:19:42,319-->00:19:45,319
Even if Concubine Wan did commit an error,

276
00:19:45,400-->00:19:47,359
why not punish her in the morning?

277
00:19:49,160-->00:19:54,160
Why must you wait till midday when the sun shines most fiercely?

278
00:19:55,320-->00:19:59,0
In my eyes, you are as vicious as a viper.

279
00:19:59,920-->00:20:03,599
How can I keep such a woman as my companion?

280
00:20:04,640-->00:20:06,439
Your Majesty.

281
00:20:06,520-->00:20:10,320
I was truly aggrieved by Concubine Wan's arrogance.

282
00:20:11,159-->00:20:15,119
But I never thought of harming her unborn child.

283
00:20:16,519-->00:20:19,679
I experienced the same loss myself.

284
00:20:21,0-->00:20:24,160
Your Majesty, how could I possibly be so cruel?

285
00:20:26,400-->00:20:30,40
"Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself."

286
00:20:31,199-->00:20:33,880
The Empress will instruct the harem concerning my decree.

287
00:20:33,959-->00:20:37,599
For Consort Hua of the Nian family, the honorific name "Hua" is revoked.

288
00:20:37,680-->00:20:41,79
Her power to assist in the affairs of the harem is annulled.

289
00:20:41,839-->00:20:44,279
She is forbidden to approach me without being summoned.

290
00:20:45,240-->00:20:48,920
I will execute your decree. Your Majesty, please rest assured.

291
00:20:49,519-->00:20:51,39
Your Majesty.

292
00:20:51,640-->00:20:54,239
It was an unwitting blunder.

293
00:20:54,880-->00:20:57,519
Your Majesty, how can you be so merciless?

294
00:21:02,519-->00:21:04,400
How innocent Concubine Wan was.

295
00:21:06,200-->00:21:08,599
How innocent all the concubines were!

296
00:21:09,199-->00:21:12,760
They all had to endure the scorching sun with Concubine Wan!

297
00:21:16,400-->00:21:17,400
From now on,

298
00:21:18,880-->00:21:20,480
every midday,

299
00:21:20,559-->00:21:25,359
you must kneel at the gate of your palace for four hours.

300
00:21:29,840-->00:21:30,839
Be gone!

301
00:21:45,720-->00:21:49,440
You may all leave. I will remain with Concubine Wan.

302
00:21:49,519-->00:21:50,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

303
00:21:51,480-->00:21:54,199
Concubine Wan, your health is most important.

304
00:21:55,119-->00:21:58,599
You have many years ahead of you. Be measured in your grief.

305
00:22:02,280-->00:22:03,759
This time...

306
00:22:04,799-->00:22:07,920
if Marquess Guo had not rescued you from Yikun Palace

307
00:22:08,960-->00:22:11,760
and sent a messenger to report to me,

308
00:22:12,839-->00:22:16,400
I cannot imagine how much worse it might have turned out.

309
00:22:17,880-->00:22:19,359
Your Majesty, I venture to ask.

310
00:22:20,640-->00:22:25,160
Did my child just die for nothing?

311
00:22:26,279-->00:22:28,880
Why not kill that wench to vent our hatred?

312
00:22:32,680-->00:22:35,119
We are hard pressed for allies in the field.

313
00:22:35,199-->00:22:37,359
I must take that into consideration.

314
00:22:38,279-->00:22:41,200
Yet she has killed your own child, Your Majesty.

315
00:22:44,720-->00:22:46,280
Huan Huan.

316
00:22:47,119-->00:22:51,160
For my sake, please endure this a while longer.

317
00:22:51,959-->00:22:53,359
Do not make it difficult for me.

318
00:23:13,719-->00:23:17,839
Nian Gengyao has sent his regards with this memorandum. Take a look.

319
00:23:22,640-->00:23:27,79
General Nian is as engaged with family affairs as he is with affairs of state.

320
00:23:27,160-->00:23:31,519
He has inquired about Consort Nian in every memorandum.

321
00:23:31,599-->00:23:33,440
Obviously, he does so intentionally.

322
00:23:33,520-->00:23:37,559
If he lacks all propriety before you, he offends and disrespects the Emperor.

323
00:23:37,640-->00:23:40,880
If he lacks propriety before the people, he offends everyone in the country

324
00:23:40,959-->00:23:43,839
and ignores the imperial favors granted to him.

325
00:23:43,920-->00:23:47,759
If you were Emperor, what would you do?

326
00:23:51,160-->00:23:54,199
"When you do not hold an office, you need not consider policy."

327
00:23:54,280-->00:23:56,720
I am softhearted and incapable of handling serious matters.

328
00:23:56,799-->00:23:58,680
The tears of a beauty cause me to lose my head.

329
00:23:58,759-->00:24:02,720
To involve me in important affairs is to invite disaster.

330
00:24:02,800-->00:24:05,240
I feel you have shirked your duties at the court.

331
00:24:06,160-->00:24:09,199
I shall no longer allow you to remain aloof from these affairs.

332
00:24:10,599-->00:24:14,720
There is a matter with which I truly need your help.

333
00:24:15,400-->00:24:17,79
Simply say the word and I will comply.

334
00:24:18,0-->00:24:20,80
Your Majesty, I am at your command.

335
00:24:24,39-->00:24:27,640
Your Majesty said you did not wish to hold an audition for the harem.

336
00:24:28,440-->00:24:32,839
I've selected several beauties of grace from among the imperial maids.

337
00:24:32,920-->00:24:36,200
Your Majesty, please have a look and see if one catches your fancy.

338
00:24:37,200-->00:24:41,799
I drank overmuch. Maybe another day.

339
00:24:41,880-->00:24:44,119
This female singer has been training for a long time.

340
00:24:44,200-->00:24:47,559
I simply hope her performance may please you.

341
00:24:48,680-->00:24:50,280
Let her begin.

342
00:24:50,359-->00:24:57,319
Lotus blossoms abound to be picked to the south of the Yangtze

343
00:25:00,920-->00:25:04,240
Her voice is soft, gentle and gracious.

344
00:25:04,319-->00:25:07,160
It is somehow quite moving.

345
00:25:08,319-->00:25:10,759
Her dress is truly befitting.

346
00:25:11,319-->00:25:13,239
I see that she has taken great pains.

347
00:25:13,319-->00:25:17,79
No matter how beautiful her attire, her voice is even more striking.

348
00:25:20,399-->00:25:21,880
Why does she cover her face?

349
00:25:22,400-->00:25:25,759
Is she so unsightly that she must hide it?

350
00:25:25,839-->00:25:27,400
Her singing skills are exceptional.

351
00:25:27,480-->00:25:31,79
Even better than Attendant Yu and Attendant An.

352
00:25:31,160-->00:25:34,640
Does her voice remind you of another's?

353
00:25:34,720-->00:25:36,720
It is somehow similar to Lingrong's,

354
00:25:37,319-->00:25:39,759
yet more pure and delicate.

355
00:25:41,359-->00:25:45,159
Where is Lingrong? Why is she not in attendance?

356
00:25:45,240-->00:25:47,359
She is suffering from a cough.

357
00:25:47,439-->00:25:49,440
It's natural she should avoid meeting others.

358
00:25:57,319-->00:26:02,39
"Such a beauty as she should be held in my arms at first sight."

359
00:26:14,400-->00:26:17,439
Your Majesty, do you not recognize her?

360
00:26:22,319-->00:26:25,839
I, An Lingrong, bow in respect before Your Majesty.

361
00:26:26,880-->00:26:28,839
Were you not ill?

362
00:26:28,920-->00:26:31,839
Her Highness the Empress sent one to care for me. I've already recovered.

363
00:26:33,559-->00:26:36,520
Not only have you recovered, but your voice has improved greatly.

364
00:26:37,599-->00:26:40,160
The Empress has outdone herself.

365
00:26:40,239-->00:26:44,759
It is a great good fortune to have you by my side.

366
00:26:46,719-->00:26:51,559
I saw that Your Majesty was dispirited, so I was compelled to take such measures.

367
00:26:51,640-->00:26:54,719
I only hoped to restore good cheer and good health to Your Majesty.

368
00:26:54,800-->00:26:56,200
Watch your step.

369
00:27:02,359-->00:27:06,559
At this time last year, Lingrong was promoted to First Attendant.

370
00:27:07,359-->00:27:10,520
Today she is promoted to Noble Lady.

371
00:27:12,40-->00:27:14,480
Your Majesty is truly generous.

372
00:27:26,920-->00:27:29,160
Your face is still quite pale.

373
00:27:29,239-->00:27:32,519
Have you eaten the edible bird's nests brought by Su Peisheng?

374
00:27:32,599-->00:27:34,160
Yes, I have.

375
00:27:34,240-->00:27:38,240
Yet it takes time to make a full recovery. It will not take effect so quickly.

376
00:27:42,240-->00:27:46,280
I see that the scar on your neck has disappeared.

377
00:27:46,359-->00:27:48,640
It's fortunate that your face was not marred.

378
00:27:49,200-->00:27:51,480
If a scar were left on your face,

379
00:27:51,559-->00:27:54,160
it would be as a slight flaw in pure white jade.

380
00:27:55,200-->00:27:57,999
Your Majesty, it seems you treasure my appearance.

381
00:27:58,79-->00:28:00,79
Huan Huan's beauty merits praise.

382
00:28:00,159-->00:28:02,839
Only now I learn that you care for my appearance to this degree.

383
00:28:14,160-->00:28:17,119
Concubine Wan, you are overly assertive.

384
00:28:17,759-->00:28:19,599
In consideration for your recent loss,

385
00:28:19,679-->00:28:21,640
I shall overlook your disrespect this time.

386
00:28:21,720-->00:28:24,359
You must try to calm your emotions.

387
00:28:30,960-->00:28:33,680
Your Highness, are you not fond of Concubine Wan?

388
00:28:33,759-->00:28:36,239
Why is it that you do not encourage His Majesty,

389
00:28:36,319-->00:28:38,880
but rather dissuade him from visiting her?

390
00:28:39,519-->00:28:41,960
I know my own son very well.

391
00:28:43,519-->00:28:46,799
The Emperor is overly attached to Concubine Wan.

392
00:28:46,880-->00:28:50,240
That's why he was troubled to see Concubine Wan grieving.

393
00:28:52,359-->00:28:54,359
The Emperor may show favor to any concubine,

394
00:28:55,680-->00:28:57,560
but not exclusively.

395
00:28:57,640-->00:28:59,840
Consort Nian has fallen from his favor.

396
00:28:59,920-->00:29:04,359
If Concubine Wan becomes dominant, the harem will be unbalanced.

397
00:29:04,999-->00:29:08,719
Besides, there is not much submissiveness in Concubine Wan's temperament.

398
00:29:09,359-->00:29:11,520
She needs to temper herself.

399
00:29:15,839-->00:29:19,640
The Household Department is busy making dresses with Sichuan brocade for Lady An.

400
00:29:23,160-->00:29:27,119
Lingrong is fortunate. She now enjoys His Majesty's favor exclusively.

401
00:29:31,319-->00:29:32,800
Mei is here.

402
00:29:32,880-->00:29:34,760
Why are you making winter clothing yourselves?

403
00:29:37,359-->00:29:39,680
The Imperial Household Department is too busy to make them.

404
00:29:40,279-->00:29:43,200
- I want to take you somewhere. - Let me put away this silk thread.

405
00:29:43,280-->00:29:45,159
Come.

406
00:29:45,240-->00:29:47,200
- Where are we going? - Let's go.

407
00:29:47,959-->00:29:51,759
- Mei, that is the Cold Palace. - Come quickly.

408
00:29:54,239-->00:29:56,599
When will His Majesty come?

409
00:29:56,679-->00:30:00,119
- I won. - You cheated.

410
00:30:00,200-->00:30:03,0
Someday His Majesty will be fond of me.

411
00:30:03,920-->00:30:07,400
How could His Majesty still remember you?

412
00:30:07,479-->00:30:08,999
Look at you. You smell.

413
00:30:09,800-->00:30:11,279
I won't give it to you.

414
00:30:20,160-->00:30:21,799
Are you all right?

415
00:30:22,520-->00:30:24,239
The reason you brought me here

416
00:30:25,160-->00:30:27,999
was not to see Concubine Li, was it?

417
00:30:28,880-->00:30:31,920
Did you notice the lady next to Concubine Li?

418
00:30:33,479-->00:30:36,359
She was a Noble Lady who served His Majesty before.

419
00:30:37,559-->00:30:39,160
Who is she?

420
00:30:39,239-->00:30:41,240
It doesn't matter who she is.

421
00:30:41,319-->00:30:43,440
It only matters that she was once with child,

422
00:30:43,519-->00:30:44,799
then had a miscarriage due to a fall.

423
00:30:44,880-->00:30:48,200
She lost His Majesty's favor due to her excessive grief.

424
00:30:48,799-->00:30:52,839
Afterwards, she slandered Consort Nian, claiming she had killed her unborn child.

425
00:30:52,920-->00:30:55,119
And for that, she was sent to the Cold Palace.

426
00:30:56,159-->00:30:58,480
If you continue to succumb to despair,

427
00:30:58,559-->00:31:03,640
you will eventually meet the same fate as those we have just seen.

428
00:31:12,920-->00:31:14,520
Come quickly.

429
00:31:19,359-->00:31:20,359
Concubine Wan.

430
00:31:21,959-->00:31:23,880
Consort Qi, please forgive me.

431
00:31:23,960-->00:31:27,319
Let it be. Go as far away as you can.

432
00:31:27,400-->00:31:29,279
My lady, you forget yourself.

433
00:31:29,920-->00:31:32,0
Consort Nian has fallen out of favor.

434
00:31:32,79-->00:31:35,359
Consort Jing is incompetent. Consort Duan is gravely ill.

435
00:31:35,440-->00:31:37,999
You are the most powerful Consort in the palace at this moment.

436
00:31:38,79-->00:31:41,0
If you don't assert your authority by showing haughty superiority now,

437
00:31:41,79-->00:31:43,880
who will even remember Consort Qi in the future?

438
00:31:45,240-->00:31:46,640
My lady, think it over.

439
00:31:46,719-->00:31:49,720
If not for this minx, how could His Majesty neglect us?

440
00:31:49,799-->00:31:52,240
It was her pregnancy that claimed the life of my child!

441
00:31:52,319-->00:31:53,920
I remember!

442
00:31:54,640-->00:31:57,359
It's all your fault.

443
00:31:58,920-->00:32:01,880
Lady Fucha says that my pregnancy claimed the life of her child.

444
00:32:01,959-->00:32:04,879
Then what of my child? Who should be responsible for my loss?

445
00:32:05,879-->00:32:10,79
You discovered your child at the very moment I lost mine.

446
00:32:10,880-->00:32:14,40
When I suffered the most, you enjoyed your proudest moment.

447
00:32:14,119-->00:32:16,200
If not you, then who was responsible?

448
00:32:16,279-->00:32:18,759
Everything happens for a reason.

449
00:32:19,439-->00:32:21,839
Good. Very good.

450
00:32:23,599-->00:32:27,39
You even dare to offend me now.

451
00:32:28,720-->00:32:32,520
Cuiguo, slap her until she bleeds at the mouth.

452
00:32:35,240-->00:32:36,519
Begin.

453
00:32:37,279-->00:32:39,160
Only when she feels pain,

454
00:32:39,240-->00:32:42,0
will she realize how much of it she caused for Consort Qi and myself.

455
00:32:58,879-->00:33:01,840
Young mistress, let's roll a boiled egg on your cheek.

456
00:33:01,920-->00:33:03,960
It will reduce the swelling.

457
00:33:07,480-->00:33:09,359
Why did you yield to Consort Qi?

458
00:33:09,440-->00:33:11,520
It matters not. You may offend her openly.

459
00:33:12,439-->00:33:14,119
Offend her openly?

460
00:33:15,319-->00:33:17,840
Who am I now? How can I afford to do so?

461
00:33:21,79-->00:33:23,200
Lady Fucha was right.

462
00:33:24,599-->00:33:26,600
As I started feeling physical pain,

463
00:33:27,400-->00:33:29,839
I began to realize how much pain remains in my heart.

464
00:33:32,679-->00:33:33,719
Liuzhu.

465
00:33:35,320-->00:33:39,559
Ask Xiao Yunzi to capture some butterflies.

466
00:33:40,399-->00:33:45,40
Young mistress, it is hard to find butterflies at this season.

467
00:33:45,119-->00:33:47,359
They are out of season now.

468
00:33:49,79-->00:33:50,479
But I must obtain some.

469
00:33:51,479-->00:33:53,80
They must be the most beautiful kind.

470
00:33:54,599-->00:33:55,640
Yes, young mistress.

471
00:34:01,880-->00:34:04,839
I greet Your Majesty and Your Highness.

472
00:34:04,920-->00:34:08,760
I have arrived late for good reason. Your Majesty, please forgive me.

473
00:34:08,840-->00:34:10,360
No matter. You may rise.

474
00:34:10,960-->00:34:12,439
Thank you, Your Majesty.

475
00:34:12,519-->00:34:15,800
Why are you late? Did something happen?

476
00:34:15,880-->00:34:19,400
I was passing by Yimei Garden and saw new plum blossoms.

477
00:34:19,920-->00:34:22,480
I couldn't help but stop to view them, so I arrived late.

478
00:34:23,280-->00:34:25,79
Have the plum blossoms in Yimei Garden all bloomed?

479
00:34:25,999-->00:34:28,239
They have come into glorious full bloom.

480
00:34:30,159-->00:34:33,960
Lady Hui, how could I miss such a wonderful sight?

481
00:34:34,39-->00:34:36,840
Why don't you walk with me so we may enjoy it together?

482
00:34:37,440-->00:34:39,920
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

483
00:34:39,999-->00:34:43,40
Plum blossoms in the snows of winter. Don't keep this wonder to yourself.

484
00:34:43,119-->00:34:45,920
Please bring us along as well.

485
00:34:48,199-->00:34:51,0
I am a pious girl from the Zhen family without talent or virtue.

486
00:34:51,800-->00:34:53,920
I was unable to carry an imperial heir to term.

487
00:34:53,999-->00:34:56,280
Overwhelmed by guilt, I cannot look the Emperor in the face.

488
00:34:57,280-->00:35:00,199
I sincerely pray that the Emperor will be blessed by Heaven,

489
00:35:00,280-->00:35:01,480
have peace and joy

490
00:35:02,439-->00:35:04,320
and enjoy long life and blessings.

491
00:35:04,400-->00:35:08,80
If my wish should come to pass, I will renounce eating meat

492
00:35:08,159-->00:35:09,760
and go without His Majesty's favor.

493
00:35:09,840-->00:35:10,920
Huan Huan.

494
00:35:13,40-->00:35:14,40
Is that you?

495
00:35:16,80-->00:35:18,479
I am unable to look Your Majesty in the face.

496
00:35:20,479-->00:35:24,199
Why are you unable? Do you no longer wish to see me?

497
00:35:24,280-->00:35:25,920
Please come no closer.

498
00:35:33,599-->00:35:37,0
Your hands are freezing cold. Have you no fear of falling ill again?

499
00:35:39,679-->00:35:41,679
I only thought of my prayers for Your Majesty.

500
00:35:43,40-->00:35:46,80
If I have caused Your Majesty concern, it is certainly my fault.

501
00:35:46,679-->00:35:48,239
I must excuse myself now.

502
00:36:25,560-->00:36:27,159
Such a sweet fragrance.

503
00:36:28,40-->00:36:33,119
It is no surprise that butterflies are drawn to you even in wintertime.

504
00:36:33,199-->00:36:36,640
In the same way, I am captivated by you.

505
00:36:39,559-->00:36:42,239
I have prayed for Your Majesty day and night.

506
00:36:42,320-->00:36:45,480
Bathing and burning incense, I dare not neglect the slightest detail.

507
00:36:48,599-->00:36:50,519
This is wonderful.

508
00:36:50,600-->00:36:55,79
Concubine Wan has not set foot outside her residence since the miscarriage.

509
00:36:55,160-->00:36:57,879
I have been concerned for several months.

510
00:36:58,640-->00:37:01,159
I have prayed for both of you day and night.

511
00:37:01,239-->00:37:04,360
I wished for you both to be reconciled, without a breach between you any longer.

512
00:37:04,439-->00:37:08,119
When was there ever a breach between Huan Huan and myself?

513
00:37:13,440-->00:37:15,319
Never.

514
00:37:15,400-->00:37:19,320
It is merely that I have not been well and could not serve Your Majesty.

515
00:37:33,199-->00:37:36,559
I am incompetent. I am unable to win His Majesty's favor.

516
00:37:36,640-->00:37:39,320
It is no fault of yours. Concubine Wan is overly competent.

517
00:37:40,79-->00:37:41,159
You enjoyed His Majesty's favor exclusively

518
00:37:41,239-->00:37:43,280
when she was absent.

519
00:37:43,360-->00:37:47,360
But with her present, you are unable to share in it.

520
00:37:47,439-->00:37:50,879
Huan has not served him for some time. He naturally feels a sense of novelty.

521
00:37:50,960-->00:37:52,119
Then what of the future?

522
00:37:53,440-->00:37:55,760
You have served His Majesty for quite some time.

523
00:37:55,840-->00:37:58,320
Do you still want to catch his eye in the future?

524
00:37:59,880-->00:38:03,199
Your Highness, please guide me.

525
00:38:08,520-->00:38:12,79
In fact, we concubines should gather frequently for conversation.

526
00:38:12,159-->00:38:15,360
If we are close, misunderstanding and dissent will disappear naturally.

527
00:38:15,440-->00:38:19,719
We are all companions to His Majesty. There should be no dissent between us.

528
00:38:19,800-->00:38:23,480
In such weather, I'm reminded of a story that took place in the wintertime.

529
00:38:24,80-->00:38:25,719
I do not remember it very well,

530
00:38:26,679-->00:38:28,840
but during the reign of the Han Emperor,

531
00:38:28,919-->00:38:31,639
Consort Qi was in favor and offended Empress Lu.

532
00:38:31,719-->00:38:33,920
Later, Empress Lu became Empress Dowager.

533
00:38:34,0-->00:38:36,320
She chopped off Consort Qi's hands and legs,

534
00:38:36,400-->00:38:38,760
gouged out her eyes, cut off her ears and made her mute.

535
00:38:38,840-->00:38:41,839
She had her locked in the latrine and called her a "human swine."

536
00:38:42,360-->00:38:45,400
Consort Qi had once been a great beauty.

537
00:38:45,480-->00:38:48,599
It is a pity that she ended up that way.

538
00:38:48,679-->00:38:50,919
Though Empress Lu was ruthless,

539
00:38:51,0-->00:38:54,679
it was Consort Qi who dared humiliate her, having long been doted upon.

540
00:38:54,760-->00:38:57,439
She brought great trouble upon herself indeed.

541
00:38:57,519-->00:39:01,719
It is thus clear that Empress Lu was a very vindictive woman indeed.

542
00:39:02,360-->00:39:06,239
Lady Fucha, don't you agree?

543
00:39:07,80-->00:39:10,320
Jinxi, help Lady Fucha sit up properly.

544
00:39:10,399-->00:39:14,480
We're just telling stories. Lady Fucha, what's the matter?

545
00:39:14,559-->00:39:18,399
I have heard of another story that is even more horrifying.

546
00:39:18,479-->00:39:21,919
During the Tang Dynasty, two concubines were made into "human swine."

547
00:39:22,840-->00:39:25,999
Then they were immersed in wine jars.

548
00:39:26,79-->00:39:27,280
They were called...

549
00:39:28,400-->00:39:29,400
Bone Liquor.

550
00:39:31,120-->00:39:32,920
These acts were utterly merciless,

551
00:39:33,399-->00:39:35,280
but everything happens for a reason.

552
00:39:35,360-->00:39:37,40
It was to be expected.

553
00:39:48,560-->00:39:50,800
Young mistress, what's the matter?

554
00:39:50,879-->00:39:52,239
Young mistress, wake up!

555
00:39:52,319-->00:39:53,920
She first struck me as quite bold.

556
00:39:54,520-->00:39:57,719
But she is merely a coward who made a display of her toughness.

557
00:39:57,800-->00:40:00,800
Jinxi, Lady Fucha is not well. Carry her back to her residence.

558
00:40:02,39-->00:40:03,320
Yes, mistress.

559
00:40:04,320-->00:40:07,119
You would beat an defenseless dog to scare away a lion.

560
00:40:07,199-->00:40:09,840
Now the dog has been beaten.

561
00:40:09,920-->00:40:13,199
Having seen it, I eagerly await what you have to tell me.

562
00:40:13,280-->00:40:17,239
It's a pleasure to speak with someone as clever as yourself. It's much easier.

563
00:40:18,679-->00:40:20,919
You have been stained by the disgrace of Consort Nian.

564
00:40:21,0-->00:40:23,400
Princess Wenyi has fallen into neglect as well.

565
00:40:23,480-->00:40:26,600
It seems His Majesty has not visited you in about half a year.

566
00:40:26,679-->00:40:29,40
It's my own fault for being so shortsighted.

567
00:40:29,119-->00:40:32,679
I should have chosen a better master. To my chagrin, I chose wrongly.

568
00:40:33,479-->00:40:36,79
I dare blame no other for that.

569
00:40:37,40-->00:40:39,679
Yet you are still seen as closely tied to Consort Nian.

570
00:40:40,360-->00:40:42,239
What will you do?

571
00:40:42,320-->00:40:46,359
In truth, I am greatly concerned for my future.

572
00:40:46,440-->00:40:49,839
I simply hope that Consort Nian will not cause me trouble.

573
00:40:49,920-->00:40:52,400
In fact, you are equally as clever as Consort Nian.

574
00:40:53,199-->00:40:56,199
You followed her in the past merely to secure your own standing.

575
00:41:05,479-->00:41:06,679
Lady Fucha.

576
00:41:06,760-->00:41:10,560
- They will make me into a human swine. - Who would do that?

577
00:41:10,639-->00:41:12,879
- My lady, help! - It's impossible. No one would dare.

578
00:41:12,960-->00:41:15,400
- Don't let them! - It's impossible.

579
00:41:15,480-->00:41:16,679
You.

580
00:41:16,760-->00:41:18,760
- What has happened to your mistress? - Nothing, my lady.

581
00:41:18,840-->00:41:22,280
But a few days ago, she had a talk with Concubine Wan and Lady Cao.

582
00:41:22,360-->00:41:26,880
She fainted then and has remained in this state since she was revived.

583
00:41:28,400-->00:41:32,880
- Did Concubine Wan intimidate her? - It made no sense.

584
00:41:32,960-->00:41:36,800
Lady Cao was there as well. But she didn't have such a shock.

585
00:41:40,679-->00:41:43,519
Young mistress, Consort Qi is outside. She asks to see you urgently.

586
00:41:45,0-->00:41:46,520
I don't have time.

587
00:41:47,120-->00:41:50,640
Go tell her that Lady Fucha's state will not bring trouble upon her.

588
00:41:50,719-->00:41:52,119
Tell her to behave.

589
00:41:52,199-->00:41:53,480
Yes, my lady.

590
00:42:00,199-->00:42:03,719
Consort Nian is said to be ruthless and brash. Everyone fears her iron fist.

591
00:42:04,439-->00:42:06,760
But these tactics may prove quite effective

592
00:42:06,840-->00:42:09,359
in dealing with those who oppose you.

593
00:42:09,440-->00:42:13,479
I must learn the essence of Consort Nian's style and use it in the future.

594
00:42:14,719-->00:42:17,280
In the past, I was subjected to cruel oppression.

595
00:42:17,360-->00:42:19,600
It is time to change that situation.

596
00:42:21,79-->00:42:23,920
How does it feel to wait for someone who never comes?

597
00:42:23,999-->00:42:26,360
Now I finally understand.

598
00:42:27,560-->00:42:30,480
I wonder if I keep watch like this,

599
00:42:30,559-->00:42:33,239
will His Majesty finally arrive?

600
00:42:33,320-->00:42:34,439
My lady, rest easy.

601
00:42:34,519-->00:42:38,880
General Nian has sent word that he knows you are neglected.

602
00:42:39,480-->00:42:41,39
He has made a compact with Duke Dun

603
00:42:41,119-->00:42:43,640
to sound out His Majesty's true intentions.

604
00:42:45,199-->00:42:49,519
No matter what may have happened, why did he realign himself with Duke Dun?

605
00:42:50,119-->00:42:53,359
Though Duke Dun, the 10th prince, has helped him in the past,

606
00:42:53,440-->00:42:55,760
it is improper to be closely associated with him.

607
00:42:58,879-->00:42:59,880
You have returned.

608
00:42:59,959-->00:43:02,960
Your Majesty, I rode hard on a swift horse and intercepted this.

609
00:43:05,440-->00:43:07,760
From a carrier pigeon at Duke Dun's residence.

610
00:43:12,39-->00:43:15,280
As I expected, Duke Dun has won Nian Gengyao's support

611
00:43:16,80-->00:43:17,920
to usurp the throne

612
00:43:18,520-->00:43:20,600
and recognize Yunzi as Emperor,

613
00:43:20,679-->00:43:24,239
as well as Consort Dowager Yi, mother of Yuntang, as Empress Dowager.

614
00:43:24,320-->00:43:26,760
The 10th prince's plan will surely fail this time.

615
00:43:26,839-->00:43:30,880
If he succeeds, the Qing Dynasty will come to an end.

616
00:43:30,959-->00:43:32,439
Xia Yi.

617
00:43:34,839-->00:43:36,40
Your Majesty.

618
00:43:36,760-->00:43:39,80
Tell your men, the Guillotines,

619
00:43:39,159-->00:43:41,600
to watch over Duke Dun's residence for me.

620
00:43:41,679-->00:43:44,0
Tonight we will send the Cavalry Brigade to

621
00:43:44,79-->00:43:45,880
surround his residence and capture them all.

622
00:43:45,959-->00:43:47,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

623
00:43:49,0-->00:43:51,440
I am deeply indebted to you.

624
00:43:51,519-->00:43:53,440
I merely contributed my modest abilities.

625
00:43:53,520-->00:43:55,999
Only you could go near Duke Dun's residence

626
00:43:56,79-->00:43:57,879
without arousing suspicion.

627
00:43:57,960-->00:44:00,760
This solid evidence gives you sufficient reason to send in your army.

628
00:44:00,840-->00:44:05,159
Tonight I need you to watch over Duke Dun's residence for me.

629
00:44:05,239-->00:44:08,359
- If anything happens, come immediately. - Yes, Your Majesty.

630
00:44:26,239-->00:44:27,439
I greet Your Majesty.

631
00:44:27,519-->00:44:29,199
- What progress? - All is well.

632
00:44:29,280-->00:44:31,719
The Cavalry Brigade has captured Duke Dun.

633
00:44:40,799-->00:44:43,879
I am indebted to you for your assistance in this matter.

634
00:44:43,960-->00:44:48,239
I did not wish for you to witness such terrible strife between brothers.

635
00:44:49,560-->00:44:51,0
I know it was difficult.

636
00:44:55,560-->00:44:57,879
Time has passed and circumstances have changed.

637
00:44:57,960-->00:45:01,120
When I look at Consort Nian, I shudder.

638
00:45:01,199-->00:45:06,640
Fortunately, we granted Huanyi Incense to Consort Nian exclusively.

639
00:45:06,719-->00:45:10,799
One of the ingredients is musk, which has already harmed her fertility.

640
00:45:11,439-->00:45:13,719
If Consort Nian were ever to conceive a son,

641
00:45:14,320-->00:45:18,960
Nian Gengyao would surely support the child as heir to the throne.

642
00:45:19,839-->00:45:22,360
Once they forced you to abdicate,

643
00:45:22,440-->00:45:24,520
then you and I

644
00:45:24,599-->00:45:27,840
would lose everything and no longer live in peace.

645
00:45:29,79-->00:45:32,199
In the past, when Consort Nian was with child,

646
00:45:32,280-->00:45:35,360
I had no choice but to kill my own child.

647
00:45:35,440-->00:45:37,239
How could it not bring pain?

648
00:45:37,319-->00:45:41,360
At the time, we had Consort Duan carry it out.

649
00:45:41,439-->00:45:43,440
Since she has taken all of the blame,

650
00:45:44,199-->00:45:46,520
you should let it go now.

651
00:45:46,599-->00:45:49,360
So far I've lost a great many children.

652
00:45:50,320-->00:45:52,519
Who knows if that is not a punishment from heaven?

653
00:45:52,599-->00:45:56,880
I personally measured out the drug and had it sent to Consort Nian.

654
00:45:57,760-->00:46:00,800
If someone is to be punished, it should not be you to bear the worst.

655
00:46:03,320-->00:46:07,559
Consort Nian is pitiful, but her brother Nian Gengyao is to blame.

656
00:46:07,639-->00:46:09,880
He is accustomed to acting with arrogance.

657
00:46:09,960-->00:46:11,880
If he had admitted his errors sooner,

658
00:46:11,960-->00:46:15,40
he would not have reached the point of impeachment by all of the officials.

659
00:46:19,760-->00:46:21,640
Your Highness, please forgive me. I am guilty.

660
00:46:22,239-->00:46:24,120
I don't understand. What is it?

661
00:46:24,199-->00:46:27,280
I was fully aware of something but have hidden it from all others until now.

662
00:46:27,360-->00:46:29,280
I dare not hide it anymore.

663
00:46:29,360-->00:46:31,679
What is it? Tell me.

664
00:46:31,760-->00:46:34,600
Consort Nian took bribes from officials outside the palace.

665
00:46:34,679-->00:46:37,800
Then she introduced them to General Nian for promotion.

666
00:46:38,440-->00:46:40,719
Consort Nian threatened me

667
00:46:40,799-->00:46:45,40
that if I dared tell anyone, she would kill the princess and myself.

668
00:46:45,639-->00:46:47,960
Your Highness, how could Consort Nian be so brazen?

669
00:46:48,639-->00:46:52,800
- How much did she receive? - I have no idea.

670
00:46:52,880-->00:46:55,480
But the total could be in the hundreds of thousands.

671
00:46:55,560-->00:46:57,360
His Majesty cannot abide corruption.

672
00:46:57,439-->00:46:59,919
I never thought it could happen in the harem!

673
00:47:07,159-->00:47:09,39
- Bitch! - Consort Nian, what is this?

674
00:47:10,39-->00:47:12,600
How dare you betray me!

675
00:47:12,679-->00:47:14,959
Have you forgotten how you came this far?

676
00:47:15,40-->00:47:17,639
You were ready to do anything to curry favor with me.

677
00:47:17,719-->00:47:19,320
You faithless wretch!

678
00:47:19,920-->00:47:22,680
You have all heard Consort Nian.

679
00:47:22,760-->00:47:24,960
She has close ties with Lady Cao.

680
00:47:25,39-->00:47:27,800
For that reason, what Lady Cao just said is credible.

681
00:47:28,519-->00:47:30,440
Jianqiu, report to His Majesty.

682
00:47:30,519-->00:47:32,880
Ask the Office of Punishment to interrogate

683
00:47:32,960-->00:47:34,320
the servants at Yikun Palace, every one.

684
00:47:34,920-->00:47:36,800
Especially Zhou Ninghai.

685
00:47:39,80-->00:47:42,159
The crimes committed by Consort Nian are too numerous to be listed.

686
00:47:42,879-->00:47:45,760
Your Majesty, how do you intend to dispose of Consort Nian?

687
00:47:46,639-->00:47:50,800
Consort Nian has shown insufficient virtue for a high-ranking concubine.

688
00:47:52,0-->00:47:53,679
She is hereby demoted to Second Attendant.

689
00:47:54,679-->00:47:57,560
His Majesty is benevolent and treats the concubines with leniency.

690
00:47:57,639-->00:48:00,40
I have faith that Attendant Nian will repent and reform.

691
00:48:00,119-->00:48:03,320
I thank Your Majesty on behalf of Attendant Nian.

692
00:48:04,119-->00:48:06,479
Which eligible girls from deserving families

693
00:48:06,559-->00:48:08,959
will now be selected for the harem?

694
00:48:09,639-->00:48:12,560
We must give encouragement to those meritorious officials.

695
00:48:12,639-->00:48:16,639
Quite a few officials contributed to the suppression of Duke Dun.

696
00:48:17,399-->00:48:19,200
In accordance with Your Majesty's intent,

697
00:48:19,280-->00:48:21,119
I selected Guwalgiya Wenyuan,

698
00:48:21,199-->00:48:24,760
daughter of Censor-in-chief, Guwalgiya E'min,

699
00:48:24,840-->00:48:28,239
and Li Ying, sister to the Vice Commander of the Cavalry Brigade, Li Bin.

700
00:48:28,320-->00:48:30,159
You may decide, Your Majesty.

701
00:48:30,239-->00:48:31,559
The Li family belongs to the Han Banners.

702
00:48:31,639-->00:48:32,719
Exactly.

703
00:48:32,800-->00:48:35,479
The Guwalgiya family belongs to the Bordered Yellow Banner of the Manchu.

704
00:48:35,559-->00:48:39,120
There are not many concubines from the Manchu Banners.

705
00:48:39,199-->00:48:41,439
- It is well to add one more. - Yes, Your Majesty.

706
00:48:42,560-->00:48:45,40
Your Majesty, which rank you will grant her?

707
00:48:45,119-->00:48:47,679
Grant her an honorific name as Noble Lady Qi.

708
00:48:47,760-->00:48:49,960
She will enter the palace on the first of November.

709
00:48:54,280-->00:48:56,239
Your Majesty, are you still concerned about Nian Gengyao?

710
00:48:57,199-->00:49:00,440
Nian Gengyao has been discharged of all his posts.

711
00:49:01,239-->00:49:02,960
He is assigned to guard the gate.

712
00:49:04,519-->00:49:09,399
If he can act dutifully, then I will show him mercy.

713
00:49:09,480-->00:49:11,960
Yet Nian Gengyao performed guard duty

714
00:49:12,39-->00:49:14,599
in the Imperial Yellow Jacket I awarded him.

715
00:49:15,440-->00:49:19,239
He swaggered through the streets and rumors were aroused.

716
00:49:19,760-->00:49:23,559
He would have the people think that I am an unrighteous emperor.

717
00:49:24,159-->00:49:28,760
Perhaps Nian Gengyao wishes to remind you of his former merits by the Yellow Jacket.

718
00:49:29,559-->00:49:33,520
However, he thinks only of himself, ignoring Your Majesty's prestige.

719
00:49:33,679-->00:49:36,239
How can I be mindful of his former merits?

720
00:49:37,440-->00:49:38,440
Your Majesty.

721
00:49:39,840-->00:49:42,519
Attendant Nian is outside. She asks to see Your Majesty.

722
00:49:44,40-->00:49:45,80
I refuse.

723
00:49:46,159-->00:49:47,760
Your Majesty.

724
00:49:49,0-->00:49:52,319
It doesn't matter how you punish me.

725
00:49:53,119-->00:49:56,239
I only hope you spare my brother's life.

726
00:49:56,839-->00:50:01,480
You may keep him as a dog or a horse to serve at your side.

727
00:50:01,559-->00:50:03,39
Your Majesty.

728
00:50:04,879-->00:50:09,679
I beg you, Your Majesty.

729
00:50:10,960-->00:50:14,40
Considering his service in calming Qinghai Province,

730
00:50:14,119-->00:50:16,120
we cannot bear to use capital punishment.

731
00:50:16,199-->00:50:20,600
Nian Gengyao will take his own life, Nian Fu will be beheaded.

732
00:50:20,679-->00:50:24,440
All sons above the age of fifteen will be exiled to the borderlands.

733
00:50:33,639-->00:50:37,400
I greet Your Highness the Empress and all the concubines of the palace.

734
00:50:38,40-->00:50:39,440
You may rise.

735
00:50:39,520-->00:50:41,39
Thank you, Your Highness.

736
00:50:42,560-->00:50:44,440
As expected, you are a true beauty.

737
00:50:44,519-->00:50:46,679
Come forward and let me have a closer look.

738
00:50:47,360-->00:50:48,920
Yes, Your Highness.

739
00:50:50,280-->00:50:52,159
From the gifts given by the Empress,

740
00:50:52,239-->00:50:53,719
choose some fine things for Concubine Wan,

741
00:50:53,800-->00:50:56,239
as a token of my gratitude for sharing the same palace.

742
00:50:57,920-->00:51:01,359
Who is this that refuses to bow before Lady Qi?

743
00:51:03,119-->00:51:06,159
I wondered who it might be. It turns out to be Consort Hua.

744
00:51:07,319-->00:51:09,39
It appears you are quite forgetful, my lady.

745
00:51:09,120-->00:51:12,39
You still behave as in the old glorious times of your family.

746
00:51:12,119-->00:51:14,519
But you forget that even rats will abandon a sinking ship.

747
00:51:15,840-->00:51:17,840
Even rats will abandon a sinking ship.

748
00:51:18,679-->00:51:20,479
Well said indeed.

749
00:51:21,519-->00:51:23,920
You were admitted to the harem to reward your family's loyalty.

750
00:51:23,999-->00:51:26,79
What is the difference between yourself and the old me?

751
00:51:27,119-->00:51:29,199
You believed you were living out a dream.

752
00:51:29,800-->00:51:32,239
But in the end, your fate will be the same as mine.

753
00:51:32,320-->00:51:36,40
A mere low-ranking Second Attendant. How dare you offend me!

754
00:51:36,719-->00:51:39,399
Wait until I inform the Empress and Concubine Wan.

755
00:51:40,639-->00:51:44,199
And what of the Empress? And what of Concubine Wan?

756
00:51:44,800-->00:51:46,840
Didn't I defeat them before?

757
00:51:48,119-->00:51:52,480
Besides, you are merely a pawn who relies on their power and standing.

758
00:51:53,559-->00:51:56,119
Even though they may rest easy for the present,

759
00:51:56,199-->00:51:59,440
are you certain they will not fall from their high position someday?

760
00:51:59,519-->00:52:01,480
We shall wait and watch.

761
00:52:11,639-->00:52:14,320
I am told Lady Qi was quite upset last night.

762
00:52:14,400-->00:52:17,439
It's natural for a girl to be in low spirits at times.

763
00:52:18,39-->00:52:20,320
She is not one to be troubled over trifles.

764
00:52:20,400-->00:52:23,359
There must be a reason for her sulking.

765
00:52:24,719-->00:52:27,600
The only reason is Attendant Nian.

766
00:52:27,679-->00:52:32,239
What is wrong with her? Even after all that has happened, she is restless.

767
00:52:32,320-->00:52:34,159
She offends her superiors repeatedly.

768
00:52:34,239-->00:52:35,879
His Majesty is lenient time and again.

769
00:52:35,960-->00:52:38,599
Yet she chafes at it and refuses to repent.

770
00:52:38,679-->00:52:40,639
She shows little thanks for His Majesty's clemency.

771
00:52:40,719-->00:52:42,760
Tell me, what should be done?

772
00:52:42,840-->00:52:44,639
Nian Gengyao has passed away.

773
00:52:44,719-->00:52:47,840
Your Majesty has shown great mercy by allowing Attendant Nian to live.

774
00:52:47,920-->00:52:50,119
Now that she refuses to repent,

775
00:52:50,199-->00:52:52,239
must she not be severely punished?

776
00:52:52,840-->00:52:55,719
Kill her to calm the anger of all the other concubines.

777
00:52:58,360-->00:52:59,440
Come.

778
00:53:04,239-->00:53:06,0
You are quite astute.

779
00:53:13,479-->00:53:15,80
And remorseless as well.

780
00:53:24,480-->00:53:27,479
I've just heated the tranquilizer prescribed by the imperial doctor.

781
00:53:27,560-->00:53:28,879
Mistress, take it before you sleep.

782
00:53:53,480-->00:53:57,479
My lady, Lady Cao has died.

783
00:54:04,760-->00:54:07,119
Go first to make arrangements. I will arrive later.

784
00:54:08,760-->00:54:10,280
Go.

785
00:54:14,480-->00:54:18,79
Several days ago, I saw that Cao Qinmo was not well.

786
00:54:18,160-->00:54:20,479
But how could she die so suddenly?

787
00:54:21,880-->00:54:24,39
Doctor Wen told me secretly

788
00:54:24,679-->00:54:27,439
that His Majesty and the Empress Dowager were unable to tolerate her.

789
00:54:27,519-->00:54:29,719
They instructed the maid to drug her.

790
00:54:29,800-->00:54:31,599
It was she who betrayed Attendant Nian Shilan.

791
00:54:31,679-->00:54:34,119
Everyone will assume

792
00:54:34,200-->00:54:36,599
that Cao Qinmo died tormented by her guilt.

793
00:54:37,599-->00:54:40,480
Cao Qinmo was an adept in intrigue.

794
00:54:40,560-->00:54:42,439
But no matter how calculating she was,

795
00:54:42,519-->00:54:45,639
she could never match His Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

796
00:54:46,280-->00:54:49,159
Cao Qinmo betrayed Consort Hua for her own advantage.

797
00:54:49,760-->00:54:51,519
She was likely to betray another someday.

798
00:54:53,959-->00:54:58,919
Mistress, do it quickly. Burning offerings to the dead is against palace custom.

799
00:54:59,0-->00:55:02,39
If we are discovered, we will be punished severely.

800
00:55:02,120-->00:55:05,0
Only you and I remain at Yikun Palace.

801
00:55:05,640-->00:55:07,639
I am not allowed outside the Forbidden City.

802
00:55:08,280-->00:55:11,39
I have no choice but to honor my brother right here.

803
00:55:11,119-->00:55:12,119
Where else?

804
00:55:13,280-->00:55:17,800
I remain alive, but I am no different from a dead person.

805
00:55:19,519-->00:55:22,800
Mistress, don't be sad. You have many years ahead of you.

806
00:55:24,719-->00:55:27,0
His Majesty is utterly ruthless.

807
00:55:29,239-->00:55:32,39
It is all on account of that wretched Zhen Huan.

808
00:55:33,800-->00:55:35,719
Even after my dying breath,

809
00:55:36,640-->00:55:39,39
I will not forgive her.

810
00:55:43,280-->00:55:44,760
Where is Suxi?

811
00:55:45,360-->00:55:48,679
He has already left to fulfill your orders, mistress.

812
00:55:51,519-->00:55:54,159
- A report, my lady. - What is it?

813
00:55:54,239-->00:55:56,159
I have noticed something in the past few days.

814
00:55:56,239-->00:55:58,599
It seems one has been observing us from outside.

815
00:55:59,919-->00:56:00,999
Did you see him clearly?

816
00:56:01,80-->00:56:04,200
Yes. He pretended to be sweeping the road.

817
00:56:04,280-->00:56:06,559
In fact, he was hiding at the foot of the wall to spy.

818
00:56:07,599-->00:56:09,960
Did you see his face? Which palace is he from?

819
00:56:10,39-->00:56:13,119
He is a eunuch who serves Attendant Nian, named Suxi.

820
00:56:13,760-->00:56:17,520
Since Zhou Ninghai was terminated, Suxi has been serving Attendant Nian.

821
00:56:17,599-->00:56:19,439
I also observed that he was carrying flint.

822
00:56:19,519-->00:56:21,239
His intent is malicious.

823
00:56:21,320-->00:56:24,520
He has not yet had a chance only because we are heavily guarded.

824
00:56:25,320-->00:56:26,920
Do not stop him.

825
00:56:27,0-->00:56:28,719
But keep watch on him secretly.

826
00:56:28,800-->00:56:31,199
- No rash actions to alert the enemy. - Understood.

827
00:56:37,919-->00:56:40,999
- Where is Lady Qi? Has she returned? - My lady, you've forgotten.

828
00:56:41,79-->00:56:45,319
After the opera, Lady Qi went to dine at Consort Jing's palace.

829
00:56:46,159-->00:56:47,800
The snow outside has just melted.

830
00:56:47,880-->00:56:50,440
She may not find her way home in the night.

831
00:56:50,519-->00:56:52,919
Light more lanterns at the door of her residence.

832
00:57:02,199-->00:57:05,519
Suxi is here. He snuck into the side chamber where Lady Qi resides.

833
00:57:06,800-->00:57:09,960
He's waited so many days. He finally has a chance to carry it out.

834
00:57:10,39-->00:57:12,199
That depends on whether you allow him to do so.

835
00:57:13,0-->00:57:15,760
If I don't help him, then how can he report back to his mistress?

836
00:57:16,559-->00:57:19,119
What kind of riddles are the two of you playing?

837
00:57:19,200-->00:57:22,280
First go outside and wait there. Then catch him once the blaze gets strong.

838
00:57:22,360-->00:57:23,639
Yes, mistress.

839
00:57:24,880-->00:57:26,280
Mei.

840
00:57:26,360-->00:57:28,800
Do you want to see Nian Shilan dig her own grave?

841
00:57:34,159-->00:57:37,0
Lady Qi's side chamber and warm room is connected to my quarters here.

842
00:57:37,80-->00:57:40,399
If the flames grow and come through, I won't stand a chance.

843
00:57:44,959-->00:57:47,719
The Osmanthus oil is for brushing hair. Why are you pouring it out?

844
00:57:47,800-->00:57:49,400
Don't say a word.

845
00:57:50,159-->00:57:53,159
You must tell me what you're planning.

846
00:57:54,599-->00:57:56,600
Nian Shilan sent her servant to burn me to death.

847
00:57:56,679-->00:57:59,360
I have harmed no others, but I will not let others harm me.

848
00:57:59,880-->00:58:02,239
You are going to assist her.

849
00:58:03,280-->00:58:05,640
We will use her ploy to our advantage.

850
00:58:05,719-->00:58:08,880
Very well, if we are to put on a show, then we must give it our all.

851
00:58:08,959-->00:58:11,880
I don't want to leave her any chance to live.

852
00:58:31,840-->00:58:33,560
Fire! There's a fire!

853
00:58:33,639-->00:58:36,40
Fire! Hurry!

854
00:58:37,239-->00:58:38,719
Fire!

855
00:58:41,280-->00:58:45,0
- Who is it? Who was lurking there? - This is the one who started the fire.

856
00:58:52,0-->00:58:53,959
His Majesty the Emperor!

857
00:58:56,800-->00:59:00,199
- It's all right now. Don't be frightened. - Mei was--

858
00:59:01,880-->00:59:04,0
Lady Hui, how is your wound?

859
00:59:07,40-->00:59:08,840
She must be in shock.

860
00:59:08,920-->00:59:13,440
It was all my fault. Why did I ask her to join me for chess?

861
00:59:14,40-->00:59:15,760
Concubine Wan, please rest easy.

862
00:59:15,840-->00:59:20,679
Lady Hui's mental state is not at issue. Yet she was badly burned.

863
00:59:20,760-->00:59:22,959
How could a fire start so suddenly?

864
00:59:23,40-->00:59:25,39
Where is the lead eunuch here?

865
00:59:27,800-->00:59:30,280
Your Majesty, please forgive me. I was overly careless.

866
00:59:30,360-->00:59:32,880
But I have caught the man who started the fire. He awaits your judgment.

867
00:59:32,960-->00:59:35,199
- Did someone set the blaze? - Yes, Your Majesty.

868
00:59:35,280-->00:59:36,679
- Bring him here. - Yes, sir.

869
00:59:37,360-->00:59:38,400
Bring him!

870
00:59:42,79-->00:59:44,519
When the fire broke out, this eunuch was lurking outside Suiyu Pavilion.

871
00:59:44,599-->00:59:47,960
I found flint and oil on his person. He was caught with solid evidence.

872
00:59:48,560-->00:59:50,559
What palace are you from?

873
00:59:53,400-->00:59:57,719
Your Majesty, he serves Attendant Nian at Yikun Palace. He is named Suxi.

874
00:59:59,159-->01:0:1,320
What have I done to displease him

875
01:0:1,400-->01:0:3,439
that he should try to burn the palace and end my life?

876
01:0:3,520-->01:0:5,320
Fortunately, the servants noticed.

877
01:0:5,400-->01:0:8,760
Otherwise, I would have lost my life and could never see Your Majesty again.

878
01:0:9,559-->01:0:13,40
Your Majesty, I was told Attendant Nian never got along with Concubine Wan.

879
01:0:13,119-->01:0:16,39
Now she's fallen into disgrace. Of course she must hate us both.

880
01:0:16,120-->01:0:17,599
He is merely a low eunuch.

881
01:0:17,679-->01:0:19,400
He would not dare burn down Suiyu Pavilion.

882
01:0:19,479-->01:0:20,919
Someone must be behind this.

883
01:0:22,0-->01:0:24,880
At first, I intended to show her mercy.

884
01:0:25,799-->01:0:29,320
I wanted to give her an opportunity to make a new beginning.

885
01:0:29,400-->01:0:32,679
Who could foresee that she would grow even more vicious?

886
01:0:33,719-->01:0:35,280
Let it be.

887
01:0:35,360-->01:0:37,959
Tell the Empress and Consort Jing

888
01:0:38,40-->01:0:40,360
to interrogate Suxi overnight.

889
01:0:40,439-->01:0:42,280
If his crime is proven,

890
01:0:42,360-->01:0:44,800
send Nian to the Cold Palace at once to take her own life.

891
01:0:44,880-->01:0:46,999
- No need to report to me. - Yes, Your Majesty.

892
01:0:57,760-->01:0:59,559
My residence is smaller than Suiyu Pavilion.

893
01:0:59,639-->01:1:1,959
Please tolerate this and stay here for now.

894
01:1:2,39-->01:1:4,79
I am very happy indeed that I can stay here.

895
01:1:5,559-->01:1:7,159
The new year is coming.

896
01:1:7,239-->01:1:10,360
Nian Shilan's interrogation must come to an end before New Year's.

897
01:1:10,439-->01:1:12,560
It would be unpropitious otherwise.

898
01:1:12,639-->01:1:13,960
Today is the 25th.

899
01:1:14,40-->01:1:15,999
The 29th should be the latest.

900
01:1:16,80-->01:1:18,79
She will surely die.

901
01:1:18,880-->01:1:22,40
Otherwise, I burned myself in vain.

902
01:1:22,919-->01:1:26,439
As soon as your wound heals, I will let you use the healing balm.

903
01:1:26,520-->01:1:28,679
It is the most effective way to erase the scars.

904
01:1:34,719-->01:1:36,159
Jinxi.

905
01:1:37,199-->01:1:39,960
Did Eunuch Su say at what time he would send Nian to death?

906
01:1:41,39-->01:1:44,880
At the Cold Palace, sentences are always carried out in the evening.

907
01:1:46,320-->01:1:49,200
I need to see off Consort Hua.

908
01:1:52,159-->01:1:55,480
Why was the Emperor fond of you? Do you know?

909
01:1:57,760-->01:1:59,760
Is it because of your beauty?

910
01:2:0,959-->01:2:4,119
The palace has never lacked for beautiful women.

911
01:2:4,200-->01:2:6,919
You say that His Majesty doted on me

912
01:2:7,0-->01:2:8,760
simply because I am sister to Nian Gengyao?

913
01:2:8,840-->01:2:11,79
You knew it full well in your heart.

914
01:2:11,679-->01:2:14,919
- Why deceive yourself and the others? - Nonsense!

915
01:2:15,0-->01:2:16,999
Why has His Majesty never truly loved me?

916
01:2:18,239-->01:2:20,440
Even if he did,

917
01:2:20,519-->01:2:22,999
you and Nian Gengyao have been overbearing for so many years.

918
01:2:23,599-->01:2:25,760
And that true love

919
01:2:25,840-->01:2:28,679
may long have been erased completely.

920
01:2:29,280-->01:2:30,880
How would you know, wench?

921
01:2:33,119-->01:2:37,559
When I first entered his household, he was still a Duke.

922
01:2:38,159-->01:2:40,79
I became Secondary Princess Consort.

923
01:2:42,79-->01:2:45,159
I was his favorite at the time.

924
01:2:46,359-->01:2:49,400
He said I was the only woman he loved.

925
01:2:50,400-->01:2:53,80
However, there were many women around him.

926
01:2:53,679-->01:2:55,840
More than enough to arouse my jealousy.

927
01:2:56,360-->01:2:59,760
He stayed with one concubine one night.

928
01:2:59,840-->01:3:2,880
Then he stayed with another the next.

929
01:3:7,880-->01:3:11,760
Have you ever stayed up waiting for someone until dawn?

930
01:3:11,839-->01:3:13,960
I knew from the beginning that he was the Emperor.

931
01:3:15,800-->01:3:19,600
I will never be the only woman to pass the night with him.

932
01:3:21,79-->01:3:22,680
Of course.

933
01:3:23,920-->01:3:27,199
My affection for His Majesty has been far greater than yours.

934
01:3:30,40-->01:3:34,679
Later I conceived a child. He was very happy.

935
01:3:36,440-->01:3:40,280
But gradually, the happy moments grew fewer and fewer.

936
01:3:40,719-->01:3:43,159
I could feel it.

937
01:3:44,400-->01:3:48,560
The third prince was the only child growing up at his residence.

938
01:3:49,519-->01:3:51,519
I knew that he was worried.

939
01:3:52,159-->01:3:53,760
So I told him

940
01:3:54,840-->01:3:56,639
there was no need to worry.

941
01:3:58,0-->01:4:0,479
I would give birth to a prince for him.

942
01:4:1,719-->01:4:3,320
Yet not long after that,

943
01:4:4,240-->01:4:8,120
I took the medicinal tonic served to me by Consort Duan and I lost my child!

944
01:4:10,280-->01:4:11,679
The imperial doctor told me

945
01:4:13,119-->01:4:16,880
that the child had already grown into a baby boy.

946
01:4:16,960-->01:4:18,719
You lost your child,

947
01:4:18,799-->01:4:21,599
so you wanted my child to be buried alongside yours?

948
01:4:22,959-->01:4:25,840
He was only four months in my belly.

949
01:4:25,920-->01:4:27,720
And you planned to put him to death.

950
01:4:27,800-->01:4:29,960
I never planned to kill your child!

951
01:4:30,39-->01:4:31,719
It was your lack of strength

952
01:4:31,800-->01:4:34,600
that made you miscarry after kneeling for only an hour.

953
01:4:38,200-->01:4:42,320
All women who dare vie with me for His Majesty's favor must die.

954
01:4:43,520-->01:4:45,919
Before, I instructed Yu to kill you with drugs.

955
01:4:47,40-->01:4:49,840
But I never thought of killing your child.

956
01:4:51,199-->01:4:52,560
Though it was not your intent,

957
01:4:54,39-->01:4:56,159
were it not for the Huanyi Incense in your palace,

958
01:4:56,839-->01:4:59,320
I would not have become so weak

959
01:4:59,399-->01:5:1,999
and miscarried after kneeling for only an hour.

960
01:5:5,559-->01:5:7,400
The Huanyi Incense?

961
01:5:9,599-->01:5:13,239
Do you know why you never conceived another child after your miscarriage?

962
01:5:13,919-->01:5:16,639
Did you know that Huanyi Incense contains a large amount of musk?

963
01:5:18,119-->01:5:19,999
You have been using it for a great many years.

964
01:5:20,680-->01:5:23,400
Of course you would never conceive again.

965
01:5:23,480-->01:5:25,360
Utter nonsense!

966
01:5:25,440-->01:5:27,759
That incense was granted to me by His Majesty!

967
01:5:28,479-->01:5:30,119
His Majesty.

968
01:5:34,280-->01:5:35,439
Impossible.

969
01:5:36,120-->01:5:37,280
It's impossible.

970
01:5:37,360-->01:5:39,39
If it were not by His Majesty's decre--

971
01:5:39,640-->01:5:40,840
It can't be.

972
01:5:40,920-->01:5:44,80
Why didn't any imperial doctor tell you about the musk?

973
01:5:44,839-->01:5:46,600
Not only did he make you barren,

974
01:5:46,679-->01:5:48,760
but he also caused your miscarriage.

975
01:5:49,359-->01:5:51,599
It was by His Majesty's decree as well.

976
01:5:52,199-->01:5:53,920
The medicinal tonic given by Consort Duan

977
01:5:54,640-->01:5:56,800
only served as a dissimulation to cover His Majesty's role.

978
01:5:58,479-->01:6:0,919
No matter how much safflower you have forced Consort Duan to take,

979
01:6:1,800-->01:6:3,719
it will not bring back your child.

980
01:6:3,799-->01:6:6,599
Why?

981
01:6:8,439-->01:6:9,800
Why?

982
01:6:10,959-->01:6:13,0
Because you are from the Nian family.

983
01:6:14,360-->01:6:17,40
His Majesty has long been vigilant against Nian Gengyao.

984
01:6:17,919-->01:6:20,760
He'd never let you give birth to a child bearing the blood of the Nian family.

985
01:6:47,199-->01:6:48,880
Your Majesty.

986
01:6:50,799-->01:6:52,760
Your Majesty!

987
01:6:53,840-->01:6:57,80
You have caused me so much pain!

988
01:7:30,999-->01:7:33,680
Has Nian Shilan's funeral ended?

989
01:7:34,719-->01:7:36,320
She died in such a tragic way.

990
01:7:37,360-->01:7:40,560
It seems you feel ambivalence towards her today.

991
01:7:40,640-->01:7:42,280
I thought I hated her very existence.

992
01:7:43,520-->01:7:46,679
But now that she has died, I only feel melancholy.

993
01:7:48,559-->01:7:51,360
In the beginning, she married a Duke and was favored.

994
01:7:51,439-->01:7:54,200
Who could foresee, after holding such power and prestige for years,

995
01:7:54,280-->01:7:56,479
that the man who shared her bed would scheme against her

996
01:7:57,560-->01:8:0,0
and bring her to such an end?

997
01:8:0,80-->01:8:2,199
Isn't it only natural in the palace?

998
01:8:2,520-->01:8:4,879
Intrigues for His Majesty's favor.

999
01:8:4,960-->01:8:6,999
Intrigues for status.

1000
01:8:7,439-->01:8:11,800
We intrigue for our desires. Why not the Emperor as well?

1001
01:8:11,880-->01:8:13,679
Can we not survive without intrigue?

1002
01:8:33,960-->01:8:36,520
This balm was made by Lingrong. It can remove scars.

1003
01:8:36,599-->01:8:38,120
You try it first.

1004
01:8:38,200-->01:8:40,520
If it proves effective, I will ask her to prepare more of it.

1005
01:8:42,80-->01:8:46,80
It smells sweet indeed. The scent tells me it is a good thing.

1006
01:8:46,880-->01:8:49,359
Young mistress, what is that?

1007
01:8:49,439-->01:8:52,399
This is a healing balm for removing scars.

1008
01:8:52,479-->01:8:54,79
Could you let me take a look?

1009
01:8:59,760-->01:9:1,80
Is something wrong?

1010
01:9:1,160-->01:9:5,199
I have already used several boxes, yet never felt any ill effects.

1011
01:9:5,279-->01:9:7,239
I cannot tell right now.

1012
01:9:8,159-->01:9:11,200
Would you let me take a sample and examine it?

1013
01:9:11,280-->01:9:13,640
Yes, Doctor Wen, please examine it carefully.

1014
01:9:17,359-->01:9:18,719
By the way, Your Majesty,

1015
01:9:18,799-->01:9:21,79
there are many vacant positions in the Imperial Harem.

1016
01:9:21,159-->01:9:25,0
Do you intend to select concubines to fill those openings?

1017
01:9:25,79-->01:9:26,720
Tell me your thoughts.

1018
01:9:26,800-->01:9:28,359
According to protocol, you may have one

1019
01:9:28,439-->01:9:30,839
Imperial Noble Consort, two Noble Consorts,

1020
01:9:30,919-->01:9:32,600
four Consorts, six Imperial Concubines,

1021
01:9:32,680-->01:9:34,799
and the remaining positions are not limited.

1022
01:9:34,879-->01:9:38,79
At present, you have three Consorts, Consort Duan, Consort Jing and Consort Qi,

1023
01:9:38,159-->01:9:40,319
with one Imperial Concubine, Concubine Wan.

1024
01:9:40,399-->01:9:42,720
Several positions remain to be filled.

1025
01:9:42,800-->01:9:46,160
There is no hurry to fill the positions of Noble Consort and Imperial Noble Consort.

1026
01:9:46,239-->01:9:48,760
Yet we may add one more Consort.

1027
01:9:48,840-->01:9:51,799
Let's promote Concubine Wan to Consort.

1028
01:9:54,479-->01:9:56,39
I am not qualified yet.

1029
01:9:56,119-->01:9:58,479
It is not a matter of qualifications.

1030
01:9:58,560-->01:9:59,839
Concubine Wan has outstanding virtues.

1031
01:9:59,919-->01:10:1,680
Naturally she should be promoted to Consort.

1032
01:10:1,760-->01:10:4,960
Yet it has not been long since she joined the harem and she has no child.

1033
01:10:5,640-->01:10:7,520
Someday when she gives birth to a prince,

1034
01:10:7,600-->01:10:11,359
we will promote her to Consort. It would be a great honor to her.

1035
01:10:11,439-->01:10:12,759
No matter.

1036
01:10:13,359-->01:10:15,360
We shall promote her to Consort Wan.

1037
01:10:16,600-->01:10:18,999
Your Majesty and Your Highness, thank you for your kindness.

1038
01:10:19,720-->01:10:22,239
- Rise. - Huan, congratulations. It's a great joy.

1039
01:10:23,400-->01:10:26,560
You are eager to congratulate Huan. Did you think you would be excluded?

1040
01:10:28,119-->01:10:30,399
Lady An will be promoted to Concubine An as well.

1041
01:10:31,999-->01:10:35,199
Choose an auspicious day for their conferring.

1042
01:10:35,279-->01:10:38,600
Let these two close friends be conferred on the same day.

1043
01:10:38,679-->01:10:42,439
Besides, First Attendant Xin has been serving me for quite some time.

1044
01:10:43,159-->01:10:45,439
Attendant Xin will be promoted to Noble Lady.

1045
01:10:47,520-->01:10:49,359
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1046
01:10:49,439-->01:10:51,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

1047
01:10:51,399-->01:10:52,800
Congratulations, An.

1048
01:10:54,520-->01:10:57,720
My Lady, we congratulate you on your promotion to Consort.

1049
01:10:57,800-->01:11:0,520
- You may rise. - Thank you, my lady.

1050
01:11:1,119-->01:11:4,879
Huanbi, see the Conferring Officer off. Don't forget to bring some gifts.

1051
01:11:9,120-->01:11:12,399
My lady, after the conferring ceremony, you receive instruction from the Empress.

1052
01:11:12,479-->01:11:14,680
You must show gratitude to His Majesty and Her Highness.

1053
01:11:15,279-->01:11:17,79
The Conferring Officer reminded me just now.

1054
01:11:17,680-->01:11:19,999
Liuzhu, fetch my gown and help me put it on.

1055
01:11:20,79-->01:11:21,760
Yes, mistress.

1056
01:11:25,79-->01:11:28,199
- Hurry, unfold it and see. - It's exquisite.

1057
01:11:32,319-->01:11:36,279
Oh, this is-- What will we do now?

1058
01:11:36,359-->01:11:38,359
The conferring ceremony gown is granted by His Majesty.

1059
01:11:38,439-->01:11:40,600
How can it be damaged?

1060
01:11:40,680-->01:11:44,160
If discovered later, it will be regarded as a deception of the Emperor.

1061
01:11:44,720-->01:11:48,399
Liuzhu, where is Director Jiang of the Household Department?

1062
01:11:48,479-->01:11:50,799
He just accepted our gifts. He is still in the courtyard.

1063
01:11:50,879-->01:11:52,640
- Bring him here. - Yes, mistress.

1064
01:11:52,720-->01:11:54,239
Hurry, as quickly as possible.

1065
01:11:56,439-->01:11:58,800
It's all my fault.

1066
01:11:58,880-->01:12:1,160
My headache began so suddenly.

1067
01:12:1,239-->01:12:3,40
Yet we should not miss this auspicious moment.

1068
01:12:3,119-->01:12:5,920
No matter. You may stay inside until you are well.

1069
01:12:14,279-->01:12:15,279
Empress Wan Wan?

1070
01:12:19,799-->01:12:22,40
Your Majesty, may blessings and peace be with you.

1071
01:12:24,479-->01:12:27,0
Wan Wan, why didn't you call me "my dear"?

1072
01:12:32,719-->01:12:33,719
My dear.

1073
01:12:36,439-->01:12:37,840
Wan Wan.

1074
01:12:55,759-->01:12:59,279
Wan Wan, you've finally returned.

1075
01:13:12,479-->01:13:16,560
I, Zhen Huan, bow in respect before Your Majesty.

1076
01:13:23,800-->01:13:25,79
What are you doing here?

1077
01:13:32,359-->01:13:35,40
I greet Your Majesty.

1078
01:13:35,120-->01:13:37,920
Where did you get this gown?

1079
01:13:39,520-->01:13:40,920
Impudence!

1080
01:13:42,359-->01:13:44,479
Your Majesty.

1081
01:13:46,119-->01:13:49,879
How could this happen? Huichun, how could this happen?

1082
01:13:50,920-->01:13:55,399
The other day, as Her Highness tidied Empress Chunyuan's things,

1083
01:13:55,479-->01:13:58,439
she found that two southern pearls were missing from this gown

1084
01:13:58,520-->01:14:0,479
and that silk threads were loose as well.

1085
01:14:0,560-->01:14:3,520
So I took it to the Imperial Household Department for repair.

1086
01:14:3,600-->01:14:5,680
I meant to retrieve it when I had time.

1087
01:14:7,159-->01:14:11,239
But I have been occupied these two days and forgot to retrieve it.

1088
01:14:12,720-->01:14:16,999
I don't know how this gown came to be worn by Consort Wan.

1089
01:14:17,680-->01:14:21,760
- Please forgive me, Your Highness. - Fool! How many times have I told you?

1090
01:14:21,840-->01:14:24,239
You must take extra care with Empress Chunyuan's belongings.

1091
01:14:24,840-->01:14:27,359
How dare you disregard my words!

1092
01:14:27,439-->01:14:29,479
Any other dress would be suitable.

1093
01:14:29,560-->01:14:31,560
Why did it have to be this one?

1094
01:14:35,279-->01:14:38,200
She was wearing this when we first met.

1095
01:14:39,640-->01:14:40,640
Remove it.

1096
01:14:49,920-->01:14:51,840
I have been careless.

1097
01:14:54,0-->01:14:57,319
I put on Empress Chunyuan's clothing by mistake.

1098
01:14:57,399-->01:14:58,800
Consort Wan has been meticulous in all matters.

1099
01:14:58,880-->01:15:0,600
It surely wasn't intentional.

1100
01:15:1,760-->01:15:4,119
Explain what happened.

1101
01:15:6,479-->01:15:10,640
Before leaving for the Empress's palace, I found that my gown was torn.

1102
01:15:11,800-->01:15:14,600
So I borrowed a replacement from the Imperial Household Department.

1103
01:15:15,279-->01:15:17,880
I did not know the origin of this dress.

1104
01:15:19,879-->01:15:22,120
I did not mean to offend Empress Chunyuan.

1105
01:15:22,959-->01:15:26,880
- Your Majesty, please forgive me. - Consort Wan is--

1106
01:15:26,959-->01:15:28,119
Consort Wan?

1107
01:15:29,479-->01:15:31,479
Even though the conferring ceremony has been performed,

1108
01:15:32,79-->01:15:34,999
she has not yet received instruction, and the ceremony is incomplete.

1109
01:15:36,879-->01:15:38,920
Suiyu Pavilion has been restored.

1110
01:15:39,0-->01:15:41,200
Return there to reflect on your errors.

1111
01:15:56,479-->01:15:58,560
By order of His Majesty,

1112
01:16:2,79-->01:16:6,320
Suiyu Pavilion will be closed off. No one is allowed access.

1113
01:16:6,399-->01:16:7,399
Who are you?

1114
01:16:7,479-->01:16:10,840
Director Jiang has been sentenced to death by imperial decree.

1115
01:16:10,920-->01:16:13,640
I am the new director of the Imperial Household Department.

1116
01:16:13,720-->01:16:15,319
Men, close the door.

1117
01:16:15,399-->01:16:16,680
Yes, sir.

1118
01:16:19,640-->01:16:20,640
What is this?

1119
01:16:20,720-->01:16:23,319
He who fails to fulfill his duties, will pay for it with his head.

1120
01:16:23,400-->01:16:24,399
Yes, Director Gou.

1121
01:16:24,479-->01:16:26,80
What is this?

1122
01:16:27,520-->01:16:29,639
Don't disturb the young mistress.

1123
01:16:32,520-->01:16:36,159
Young mistress, I should be held responsible for this matter as well.

1124
01:16:37,120-->01:16:39,359
I thought the gown looked familiar to me.

1125
01:16:39,439-->01:16:42,359
But I did not recall that it was Empress Chunyuan's dress.

1126
01:16:43,39-->01:16:45,880
And Director Jiang never served Empress Chunyuan.

1127
01:16:47,240-->01:16:49,920
It appears we have fallen into another trap.

1128
01:16:53,560-->01:16:55,479
Oh, Empress.

1129
01:16:56,680-->01:16:58,600
You have truly outdone yourself with this scheme.

1130
01:16:59,839-->01:17:1,399
Mistress, why do you suspect her?

1131
01:17:3,40-->01:17:5,840
If not at the Empress's command,

1132
01:17:5,920-->01:17:8,920
who would dare touch the belongings of Empress Chunyuan?

1133
01:17:9,0-->01:17:10,840
How could it be a coincidence?

1134
01:17:12,399-->01:17:15,600
"When the shepherds quarrel, the wolf has a winning hand."

1135
01:17:16,600-->01:17:19,999
I am merely a pawn in the Empress's hands.

1136
01:17:20,79-->01:17:22,40
You have never been disloyal to her.

1137
01:17:23,79-->01:17:27,80
Yet you have been elevated continuously and doted on by His Majesty.

1138
01:17:27,159-->01:17:29,319
This has likely inspired envy and dread in the Empress.

1139
01:17:30,639-->01:17:32,640
I have fallen from His Majesty's favor,

1140
01:17:33,359-->01:17:35,560
and the Empress rejects me.

1141
01:17:37,159-->01:17:39,879
Moreover, this matter concerns Empress Chunyuan.

1142
01:17:40,959-->01:17:43,760
It is the deepest grief that lies upon His Majesty's heart.

1143
01:17:44,360-->01:17:46,600
I'm afraid that what happened today

1144
01:17:46,680-->01:17:49,439
cannot take a favorable turn in a short time.

1145
01:17:49,520-->01:17:51,359
We can only wait for an opportunity.

1146
01:17:52,239-->01:17:53,840
An opportunity?

1147
01:17:57,239-->01:17:59,399
At this moment,

1148
01:18:0,720-->01:18:3,719
what difference is there between this place and the Cold Palace?

1149
01:18:7,399-->01:18:8,840
Let it be.

1150
01:18:9,439-->01:18:11,0
Let it be.

1151
01:18:14,160-->01:18:15,760
Wan Wan?

1152
01:18:17,279-->01:18:19,680
In His Majesty's heart,

1153
01:18:21,199-->01:18:24,879
I am merely a substitute for Empress Chunyuan.

1154
01:18:27,560-->01:18:31,319
My dear elder sister, you are good to me indeed.

1155
01:18:31,399-->01:18:33,840
Though you have been dead so many years,

1156
01:18:33,919-->01:18:38,200
even now you still support me and protect me.

1157
01:18:39,159-->01:18:41,439
If His Majesty shows mercy to her again,

1158
01:18:41,520-->01:18:43,800
I am afraid your efforts will be in vain, Your Highness.

1159
01:18:43,880-->01:18:46,680
This time, even if His Majesty shows mercy to her again,

1160
01:18:46,760-->01:18:49,520
I'm afraid Concubine Wan will no longer be the same.

1161
01:18:49,600-->01:18:51,399
Concubine Wan is a very proud woman.

1162
01:18:52,199-->01:18:56,439
Though she has been doted on for years, she now knows she is merely a substitute.

1163
01:18:56,520-->01:18:58,839
How can she bear it?

1164
01:19:0,399-->01:19:4,560
It turns out your true purpose was to plunge her to the depths of despair.

1165
01:19:5,600-->01:19:7,279
Truly admirable.

1166
01:19:7,359-->01:19:10,800
Guards, please open the door!

1167
01:19:10,880-->01:19:12,680
Concubine Wan is ill.

1168
01:19:12,759-->01:19:14,639
I, Xiao Yunzi, beg you on my knees.

1169
01:19:16,319-->01:19:19,40
Guard, Concubine Wan is gravely ill.

1170
01:19:19,119-->01:19:21,199
Please, His Majesty ordered her confinement.

1171
01:19:21,279-->01:19:23,40
He did not forbid her to see a doctor.

1172
01:19:23,120-->01:19:26,959
Why not have a drink with your comrades? Guard, I beg you.

1173
01:19:27,39-->01:19:29,479
By His Majesty's decree, no one is allowed to leave the palace.

1174
01:19:29,560-->01:19:32,960
Nothing else matters. Close the door.

1175
01:19:33,960-->01:19:35,399
Don't close the door!

1176
01:19:35,479-->01:19:37,439
Guard, I beg you.

1177
01:19:37,520-->01:19:39,120
Open the door, please.

1178
01:19:45,399-->01:19:46,560
Young mistress.

1179
01:19:48,760-->01:19:52,640
I am truly useless, unable to send for a doctor.

1180
01:19:53,840-->01:19:57,959
Let it be. Do not trouble the guards.

1181
01:19:58,39-->01:19:59,960
I can endure it.

1182
01:20:2,880-->01:20:6,439
Liuzhu, help me get up to take a walk.

1183
01:20:8,279-->01:20:10,680
Young mistress, what do you wish?

1184
01:20:11,359-->01:20:15,80
Taking a stroll may refresh me somewhat.

1185
01:20:30,39-->01:20:32,240
Young mistress, what is it?

1186
01:20:34,600-->01:20:36,599
- What are you doing? - Don't stop me!

1187
01:20:36,680-->01:20:38,840
- What are you doing? - Let me out!

1188
01:20:38,920-->01:20:40,680
- Step aside. - Back!

1189
01:20:40,759-->01:20:43,399
- Back, impudent one! - My lady has collapsed.

1190
01:20:44,760-->01:20:47,240
Let go of me. Let me out.

1191
01:20:47,319-->01:20:49,439
Who dares come forward?

1192
01:20:51,680-->01:20:53,0
Out of the way!

1193
01:21:1,479-->01:21:2,960
Liuzhu!

1194
01:21:3,760-->01:21:5,40
Liuzhu.

1195
01:21:6,79-->01:21:7,479
Liuzhu.

1196
01:21:9,479-->01:21:10,479
Liuzhu.

1197
01:21:11,640-->01:21:13,560
Your Majesty, I have an urgent matter to report.

1198
01:21:13,640-->01:21:14,720
Speak.

1199
01:21:14,800-->01:21:16,600
Servants at Suiyu Pavilion tried to break out.

1200
01:21:16,680-->01:21:18,79
The guards were diligent in their duties.

1201
01:21:18,160-->01:21:21,560
- A maid was injured in the conflict. - Do you know the reason?

1202
01:21:21,640-->01:21:24,600
Your Majesty, they said that Concubine Wan had collapsed.

1203
01:21:24,679-->01:21:26,920
The servants wanted to leave and send for a doctor.

1204
01:21:27,0-->01:21:29,279
The guards were faithful to your orders and would not let them leave--

1205
01:21:29,360-->01:21:30,839
Impudence!

1206
01:21:30,919-->01:21:33,240
I ordered her to be confined.

1207
01:21:33,319-->01:21:35,399
How dare you prevent her from seeing a doctor!

1208
01:21:35,479-->01:21:38,800
If Concubine Wan should have a mishap, will you take the blame?

1209
01:21:38,879-->01:21:40,79
I am guilty and deserve death.

1210
01:21:40,159-->01:21:42,239
Send the captain of the guard to the Office of Punishment.

1211
01:21:42,319-->01:21:43,319
Yes, Your Majesty.

1212
01:21:45,919-->01:21:47,680
- Su Peisheng. - Your Majesty.

1213
01:21:47,760-->01:21:49,600
Send the imperial doctor to Concubine Wan.

1214
01:21:49,680-->01:21:50,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

1215
01:21:50,760-->01:21:52,680
Report her latest condition to me at once.

1216
01:21:52,760-->01:21:54,279
Yes, Your Majesty.

1217
01:21:54,359-->01:21:56,959
- It must be Doctor Wen! - Yes, Your Majesty.

1218
01:22:2,840-->01:22:3,999
She is awake.

1219
01:22:4,560-->01:22:6,40
Do not move.

1220
01:22:6,120-->01:22:9,399
Chilblain ointment was just applied to your hands. You need to recuperate.

1221
01:22:12,0-->01:22:13,720
You must be hungry.

1222
01:22:13,800-->01:22:15,560
Come. Bring it here.

1223
01:22:16,279-->01:22:17,640
Doctor Wen prescribed a stew of

1224
01:22:17,719-->01:22:20,320
edible bird's nest with donkey-hide gelatin.

1225
01:22:20,399-->01:22:22,439
Please take it while it's warm.

1226
01:22:24,279-->01:22:25,520
Doctor Wen.

1227
01:22:26,439-->01:22:29,960
My lady, I congratulate you.

1228
01:22:30,560-->01:22:31,760
Congratulations, my lady.

1229
01:22:32,640-->01:22:36,920
My lady, Doctor Wen says that you are with child, one month.

1230
01:22:42,239-->01:22:43,280
Jinxi.

1231
01:22:45,0-->01:22:47,40
You and Doctor Wen remain here.

1232
01:22:47,640-->01:22:49,240
The rest of you may leave.

1233
01:22:56,600-->01:23:0,399
Doctor, what do you think of my condition?

1234
01:23:0,479-->01:23:3,319
This is your only chance to reestablish yourself.

1235
01:23:4,319-->01:23:9,359
His Majesty has already heard about this. He ordered me to care for you, my lady.

1236
01:23:9,439-->01:23:13,640
The Empress ordered that extra care be taken with your diet and daily activities.

1237
01:23:14,239-->01:23:16,999
My lady, you may rest easy now.

1238
01:23:17,960-->01:23:19,159
Really?

1239
01:23:20,79-->01:23:24,279
Doctor, do you think it is possible to reestablish myself?

1240
01:23:25,680-->01:23:27,280
If this is so,

1241
01:23:28,280-->01:23:30,919
you have said quite a few things,

1242
01:23:32,160-->01:23:35,640
why did you not mention the lifting of my confinement?

1243
01:23:36,840-->01:23:39,800
And His Majesty sends me no words of comfort.

1244
01:23:41,119-->01:23:42,880
Besides, your caretaking

1245
01:23:44,600-->01:23:47,119
is meant for my child only.

1246
01:23:47,999-->01:23:49,520
Not for me.

1247
01:23:50,920-->01:23:52,479
My lady.

1248
01:23:53,959-->01:23:55,239
Do not worry.

1249
01:23:56,159-->01:23:57,759
No matter how difficult,

1250
01:23:59,600-->01:24:3,560
I will not give up on myself or make this child suffer.

1251
01:24:4,520-->01:24:5,920
That is well.

1252
01:24:5,999-->01:24:9,640
Lady Hui and I feared you would be tormented.

1253
01:24:9,720-->01:24:10,880
On your word, my lady,

1254
01:24:11,479-->01:24:14,479
I shall spare no effort in caring for you.

1255
01:24:18,479-->01:24:20,399
Young mistress, you now carry a child.

1256
01:24:20,479-->01:24:23,760
What you eat nourishes the both of you. You'd better take as much as you can.

1257
01:24:25,560-->01:24:26,560
Where is Liuzhu?

1258
01:24:26,640-->01:24:29,39
She hasn't had enough rest lately.

1259
01:24:29,119-->01:24:31,719
She caught cold and is sleeping.

1260
01:24:31,800-->01:24:34,319
- I should look in on her. - Young mistress.

1261
01:24:36,320-->01:24:38,200
Liuzhu has just fallen asleep.

1262
01:24:38,800-->01:24:40,640
And you have just woken up.

1263
01:24:40,720-->01:24:43,80
Why not visit her later?

1264
01:24:43,960-->01:24:46,160
Don't try to stop me. I must look in on her.

1265
01:24:46,239-->01:24:47,479
Young mistress.

1266
01:24:48,479-->01:24:50,279
Young mistress, it's not needed.

1267
01:24:51,320-->01:24:52,399
Liuzhu is--

1268
01:24:55,720-->01:24:58,80
She is no longer here.

1269
01:25:1,119-->01:25:2,760
What did you say?

1270
01:25:3,640-->01:25:6,359
Young mistress, how do you think Doctor Wen was admitted?

1271
01:25:7,680-->01:25:10,880
The guards outside the palace did not listen to our pleas.

1272
01:25:11,880-->01:25:16,880
It was Liuzhu who threw herself onto the blade.

1273
01:25:18,119-->01:25:21,959
Fearing they had caused a death, the guards sent for Doctor Wen.

1274
01:25:22,920-->01:25:24,959
But Liuzhu--

1275
01:25:25,920-->01:25:28,159
She is no longer here.

1276
01:25:31,640-->01:25:33,719
Huanbi, you--

1277
01:25:34,680-->01:25:38,800
I should have concealed it, lest it endanger your child.

1278
01:25:42,479-->01:25:45,39
My lady, I know you are upset.

1279
01:25:45,639-->01:25:48,399
But no matter how upset you are now, you must understand

1280
01:25:48,479-->01:25:51,199
that your own health is the most important thing now.

1281
01:25:53,159-->01:25:57,720
Liuzhu died for you, my lady.

1282
01:25:57,800-->01:26:1,479
Do not let it be in vain.

1283
01:26:1,560-->01:26:5,399
Only when you have preserved yourself, will you be able to avenge Liuzhu.

1284
01:26:9,560-->01:26:12,280
From childhood, Liuzhu and I grew up together.

1285
01:26:14,760-->01:26:17,40
She was a true sister to me.

1286
01:26:18,640-->01:26:21,599
Young mistress, don't!

1287
01:26:21,680-->01:26:24,120
My lady, your hands have just been bandaged.

1288
01:26:25,800-->01:26:27,520
If you hurt yourself,

1289
01:26:28,399-->01:26:31,239
when you want to avenge Liuzhu in the future,

1290
01:26:31,999-->01:26:34,439
you will be strong in will but weak in power.

1291
01:26:35,40-->01:26:36,680
Yes, indeed.

1292
01:26:37,720-->01:26:40,200
Only if I live well,

1293
01:26:41,280-->01:26:44,39
will Liuzhu's death not be in vain.

1294
01:26:49,999-->01:26:52,159
Queen Mother, may blessings and peace be with you.

1295
01:26:52,879-->01:26:55,239
- You may rise. - Yes, Your Highness.

1296
01:26:56,119-->01:26:58,960
Whether I enjoy peace matters not.

1297
01:26:59,639-->01:27:3,279
Whether the child of the Emperor is safe is my true concern.

1298
01:27:3,880-->01:27:7,40
Do you refer to Concubine Wan's pregnancy?

1299
01:27:8,760-->01:27:10,439
I was told by His Majesty,

1300
01:27:10,920-->01:27:14,0
that Concubine Wan was hoping you would take charge of her health.

1301
01:27:15,0-->01:27:16,439
I am incompetent and lack virtue.

1302
01:27:16,520-->01:27:18,999
I can't even preserve my own eldest prince.

1303
01:27:19,79-->01:27:23,279
You are capable of this. I trust you on this point.

1304
01:27:24,399-->01:27:27,839
Since you entrust me with such a task, I dare not refuse.

1305
01:27:28,520-->01:27:32,319
You may preserve yourself only when you try to protect others.

1306
01:27:35,999-->01:27:37,600
Yes, Your Highness.

1307
01:27:38,520-->01:27:41,359
Consort Hua was arrogant and domineering in her day.

1308
01:27:41,439-->01:27:45,360
But once she fell into disgrace, everyone persecuted her mercilessly.

1309
01:27:46,39-->01:27:48,960
I also realized at that time

1310
01:27:49,40-->01:27:52,239
that Consort Hua was merely a pawn of His Majesty and the Empress Dowager

1311
01:27:52,319-->01:27:57,560
used to restrain her brother Nian Gengyao who held unparalleled power at the time.

1312
01:27:58,239-->01:28:0,439
Before her death, I went to see her

1313
01:28:0,520-->01:28:3,640
so she would realize the truth in the end.

1314
01:28:3,719-->01:28:6,999
I never imagined it was Empress Wenyu

1315
01:28:7,79-->01:28:9,200
who would gain from our conflict after all.

1316
01:28:9,840-->01:28:12,479
I brought Consort Hua to the depths of despair,

1317
01:28:12,560-->01:28:16,880
and Empress Wenyu brought me to the depths of despair.

1318
01:28:19,520-->01:28:21,120
Empress Dowager.

1319
01:28:22,640-->01:28:24,239
Empress Dowager.

1320
01:28:25,840-->01:28:28,159
Empress Dowager, what's the matter?

1321
01:28:29,520-->01:28:33,240
I am growing old now. My sight already fails me.

1322
01:28:33,319-->01:28:35,199
It cannot be.

1323
01:28:35,279-->01:28:37,800
Your Highness, you are unchanged from your youth.

1324
01:28:38,479-->01:28:40,840
Your sedan chair is ready now.

1325
01:28:40,920-->01:28:43,80
We have already walked much today.

1326
01:28:43,159-->01:28:45,720
Why not return and rest?

1327
01:28:46,319-->01:28:48,560
Very well, let's return.

1328
01:28:48,640-->01:28:50,79
Yes, Your Highness.
